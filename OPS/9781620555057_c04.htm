Incorporating these as a regular part of your diet, for two weeks to one year, can enhance free testosterone levels and positively alter the androgen/estrogen ratio. The rest of this book will look at the most important plants, supplements, and foods that can be used to increase testosterone levels and alter the androgen/estrogen balance toward the androgen side of the equation. This chapter will look at a unique class of plant medicines—phytoandrogens.</p><div id="c04s01.01"><p class="csht">P<small>HYTOANDROGENS AND</small> H<small>EALTH IN</small> M<small>IDDLE</small>-A<small>GED</small> M<small>EN</small></p><p class="ctx1">The concept of phytoandrogens, meaning plants that contain androgens or those that stimulate androgenic activity in men, is relatively new. Phytoestrogens have a much deeper history, and most clinicians and many people have at least some idea of their existence. Phytoandrogens do the same things that phytoestrogens do, except they do it for men and they do not supply estrogens, they provide androgens. Phytoandrogens increase the body’s levels of free testosterone, and they shift the androgen/estrogen balance more toward the androgen side of the equation.</p><p>Plants do this by directly supplying androgens such as testosterone, stimulating the body’s production of androgens, or by interfering with the breakdown (or conversion) of androgens into estrogens or their binding to SHBG (see chapter 2) or albumin. Pine pollen is an example of a plant that supplies significant quantities of testosterone and other androgens. The ginsengs (asian, tienchi, eleutherococcus) and tribulus are examples of plants that stimulate the production of androgens in the body. Nettle root is an example of a plant that prevents the conversion of testosterone into estrogens and interferes with its binding to inert substances in the body.</p><p>Plants that contain testosterone are ubiquitous in the environment, but very little research has been done on them. Hopefully, as knowledge of phytoandrogens becomes more widespread, research will follow along. There are a great many plants out there that contain testosterone or other androgens; it’s just that no one has been looking for them.</p><p>The following herbs are some of the most powerful phytoandrogens known so far. The plant that contains the most testosterone (and other androgens) is, at this point, pine, especially its pollen. Over the past ten years, I have experienced a great deal of benefit from it, as have a great many men from whom I have heard. David’s lily also contains substantial amounts, but at this time it is not commercially available. My own experience is that it is not as strong as pine pollen, perhaps because it must be harvested within a tiny window of time when it reaches peak testosterone production, something that is not always possible. It is included here in the hope that the information on it will stimulate commercial growers to make it available. All the other herbs are easy to find. Sources for all herbs, except David’s lily, are listed in the resource section at the end of the book.</p><p>The combination protocol outlined here will reliably act to increase testosterone levels, general energy levels, and overall sense of well-being.</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="centtb"><b>Natural Testosterone Enhancement Protocol</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Pine pollen tincture: </b>⅜ tsp. three times per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Nettle root:</b> 1200 mg per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Tribulus:</b> 500 mg three times per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Panax ginseng:</b> ¼ tsp. daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>Tienchi ginseng:</b> ⅓ tsp. three times per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Eleuthero:</b> 1 tsp. twice a day</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Pine <i>(Pinus spp.)</i> and Pine Pollen <i>(Pollen pini)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Pinaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> Pine. Specific species have different names: Scots or Scotch pine <i>(Pinus sylvestris),</i> black pine <i>(Pinus nigra),</i> Korean pine <i>(Pinus koraiensis),</i> masson pine <i>(Pinus massonia),</i> Chinese pine, aka Chinese oil pine, aka Chinese red pine <i>(Pinus tabulaeformis).</i></p><p class="ctx4"><b>Primary Species Used:</b> Although all pine pollens contain testosterone, the primary species of trees used for their pollen are <i>P. sylvestris</i> and <i>P. nigra</i> in the United States, <i>P. koraiensis</i> in Korea, and <i>P. massonia</i> and <i>P. tabulaeformis</i> in China. Any species, however, will do.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> All parts of the pine are used for medicine: the pollen, bark, seeds, and needles. To increase testosterone in the body and balance the androgen/estrogen ratio, the pollen is the primary part used. It is very high in testosterone. To a lesser extent, the seeds may also be used for this purpose, with some caveats (see chapter 6). Although the bark is excellent for many things, it normally does not contain enough testosterone and other androgens to be of use for this purpose.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names for Pine Pollen:</b> English: pine pollen, Chinese: Songhuanfen, Korean: songhwaju, Latin: pollen pini. <b>NOTE:</b> a number of sources and Web sites translate <i>pollen pini</i> as “bee pollen” and sell bee pollen as pollen pini—this is incorrect. When looking for pine pollen, care must be taken that what they are labeling pollen pini really is pine pollen and not bee pollen.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Habitat:</b> Worldwide, there are some 100 species of pines. In general, they are native to the temperate and mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They range from the arctic as far south as North Africa, the Philippines, and Central America. Only one species is indigenous south of the equator, <i>Pinus merkusii,</i> which is native to Sumatra. However, many pine species have experienced human distribution south of the equator and now grow wild wherever they were introduced. Of the species used for pine pollen, <i>P. sylvestris,</i> for example, is native to Europe from Norway to Spain and parts of Asia. It prefers a well-drained, acidic soil with full sun. It is very tolerant of dry, infertile soils.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Cultivation:</b> Pines, especially <i>Pinus sylvestris,</i> easily cultivate from seeds.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection:</b> The season for collecting pine pollen usually occurs from March to May in the northern latitudes. Mid-April is often a prime collecting period.</p><p>The male catkins that grow in a clump at the end of pine branches each look somewhat like a small, curved, corn-on-the-cob or perhaps small, curved cattails. These catkins produce the pollen that sometimes covers the ground with blankets of yellow powder during the pollen season. The catkins are collected when the pollen production is highest. In China, the catkins are placed in open tray containers to dry. Then the catkins are shaken, the pollen separated, and the catkins discarded. Because digestibility by humans of raw pine pollen is (according to producers) limited, the Chinese producers of pine pollen tablets and powders crush the pollen grains to break the cell walls before they are sold.</p><p>In the United States, the main producer of pine pollen tincture collects the pollen-laden catkins during peak pollen season and tinctures them. That is, they are placed, fresh, in a water and alcohol mix to macerate. The tincture, at maturity, is strained and stored in amber bottles out of direct sunlight.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions of Pine Pollen:</b> Strongly androgenic, increases free testosterone levels in blood, restores androgen/estrogen balance, highly nutritive (strong amino acid and vitamin source), stimulates liver regeneration, reduces blood cholesterol levels, increases superoxide dismutase levels (SOD; a potent antioxidant) in heart, liver and brain, enhances immunity, and supports healthy endocrine function.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions of Pine Seeds:</b> Moderately androgenic, strongly nutritive.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions of Pine Bark:</b> Mildly androgenic, potent antioxidant, free-radical scavenger, and lipid peroxidation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory, collagen and elastin stabilizer.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Chemistry:</b> Pine pollen contains large quantities of sterols, steroid-like substances, that are exceptionally potent. Many of these are brassinosteroids. One such, brassinoloide, is a powerful growth stimulant to plants. As little as one nanogram applied to a bean sprout can cause tremendous growth in response. Other brassinosteroids, such as castasterone and typhasterol, are also common in pine pollen. The pollen also contains a variety of endogenous gibberellins and a number of glutathione transferases. Endogenous gibberellins are plant hormones that affect cell enlargement and division. Glutathione transferases possess wide actions in living systems. They detoxify xenobiotics such as chemical carcinogens and environmental pollutants and inactivate unsaturated aldehydes, quinones, and hydroperoxides that occur as metabolites of oxidative stress. More importantly, for this book, they are intimately involved in the biosynthesis of testosterone and progesterone. Plants that grow around pine forests have come to depend on this potent nutrient source for their growth. In fact, brassinosteroids regulate gene expression in many plants. The pollen that falls to the ground or into water is generally taken up very quickly as a food and nutrient growth stimulant by other plants and living organisms in the area, including insects and animals. The brassinosteroids in pollen are actually very similar in structure to many animal steroid hormones and do exhibit steroidal activity. In addition, pine pollen contains significant amounts of human male hormones such as testosterone and androstenedione and relatively large quantities of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. A more comprehensive look at the components of pine pollen is included under the Scientific Research heading later in this section.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Pine and Pine Pollen:</b> Pine trees have a long history of use as medicines and foods. Few people now realize that the inner bark of some pines can be harvested in strips and cooked like pasta or that if dried and ground it makes a good flour.</p><p>The most androgenic part of pine trees is the pollen, although the seeds and, to a lesser extent, the bark also contain androgens. Seeds may help raise androgen levels in humans when used as a regular food additive, and an extract of the pine’s inner bark can be used as a potent antioxidant.</p><p>Emerging research has shown that, under certain circumstances, pine bark and the pulp of the tree can be powerfully androgenic. Studies have shown that female fish downstream from pine pulp mills literally transform into males from the high levels of androgens in the water. Analysis of the effluent shows “testosterone-like” impacts, according to researchers. (No other tree effluent produces this result.) The pine species normally used in pine bark extracts is <i>Pinus pinaster,</i> which grows along the Atlantic coast of France and into North Africa.</p><p>Pine pollen is a yellow, flour-like substance produced in the millions of tons each year by the pine forests of the Earth. Unlike the majority of flowering plants, pine trees are wind-pollinated. That is, they don’t have an animal or insect pollinator to help them reproduce but rely on the wind to carry the pollen to the pinecone (the female part of the plant). Each spring, the trees release the pollen from their male catkins, each of which can produce six million grains of pollen. Under magnification, a pollen grain looks much like Mickey Mouse—a big head with two huge cupped ears. The wind catches in the cupped ears, the head acting as a sort of keel hanging underneath, and the pollen sails much like a ship through the air until it finds its way inside the overlapping scale of a cone. The needles around the cones and the cones themselves literally alter wind flow patterns to more accurately funnel the pollen into place so that fertilization can take place. Under each little overlapping scale of a cone, a pine seed, or pine nut, will grow. To facilitate pollination, a great deal more pine pollen is released than is needed, and each spring the ground, streams, and ponds around and under pine forests are covered with the fine yellow pollen powder.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> Pine pollen is unknown in Ayurvedic practice as far as I can determine. A number of pines were used as medicine but mostly the trees, sap, and so on, as antibacterials and for lung complaints. However, the seeds of <i>P. gerardiana</i> have a long history of use in India as a tonic aphrodisiac and are considered to be anodyne, stimulants, and nutritive. They were sometimes used for rheumatic complaints, seminal debility, and leukorrhoea and gleet (vaginal and urethral discharges).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> Known as songhuanfen (or song huan fen), pollen from the masson pine, <i>P. massoniana,</i> and the Chinese pine,
<i>P.</i> <i>tabulaeformis</i> (usually blended together) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for millennia as a health restorative, longevity tonic, and antiaging nutrient. The oldest mention of it in ancient Chinese texts is in <i>The Pandects of Materia Medica</i> by Shen Nong of the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). Although the herb has been used for several thousand years, current Chinese production methods emphasize breaking the cell wall of the pollen to facilitate absorption. There is little literature I have been able to find that supports the need of this, especially considering the pollen’s place in traditional Chinese medicine over such a long period. A low-temperature, high-speed airflow pulverization process is used that breaks up 99 percent of the cellular material.</p><p>Traditional Chinese physicians prescribe pine pollen for moistening the lungs, relieving rheumatic pain, relieving fatigue, increasing endurance, strengthening the immune system, improving the skin, strengthening the heart, strengthening the GI tract and stomach, for increasing mental agility, for prostate problems, for increasing agility, and decreasing weight. Interestingly, many of these actions are consistent with the intake of exogenous testosterone. Pine pollen is also used externally as a poultice to arrest discharges, to stop bleeding, and for skin problems such as eczema, impetigo, acne, and diaper rash.</p><p>Korean pine pollen (called songhwaju) from <i>P. koraiensis</i> is used in Korea in much the same way that similar pine pollen is used in China, often as a tea and also as an additive in many traditional recipes. Although it is becoming harder to find (it is still used regularly in North Korea), pine pollen has traditionally been available in grocery stores in South Korea and is sold in boxes much like those that contain baking soda in the United States. Historically, it has been included regularly in food as an antiaging and invigorating additive.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Pine pollen has not been a part of traditional Western botanic medicine. It has only recently entered Western botanic practice with the emergence of interest in phytoandrogens.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Oddly, given its extensive history in China, research on pine pollen in the West is still in its infancy. What researchers have found, however, bears out the Chinese use of pine as an antiaging and vitality-enhancing medicine for men. Pine pollen is extremely high in androgens and the amino acids that support healthy endocrine function. Analysis of pollen from <i>P. sylvestris, P. nigra, P. bungeana,</i> and <i>P. tabu</i><i>laeformis</i> has shown the presence of androgenic constituents, including testosterone.</p><p><i>Pinus nigra,</i> or black pine, pollen contains the following androgens: androstenedione (0.7–0.8 mcg per 10 g, 0.000009% by weight), testosterone (0.7 mcg per 10 g, approximately 0.000009% by weight), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; about 0.1 mcg per 10 g, 0.0000015% by weight), and androsterone (approx. 0.2 mcg per 10 g, 0.0000022% by weight). The testosterone in <i>Pinus bungeana</i> pollen runs 11 ng per 0.1 g dry weight, and that in <i>P. tabulaeformis</i> runs 27 ng per 0.1 g dry weight.</p><p>Although these amounts might seem small, recall that it takes as little as 4 ng (one-thousandth of a microgram) to change our sex to men while we are developing in the womb. That can be represented as 0.004 mcg. Androgens are very potent chemicals. In comparison with that amount, <i>P. nigra</i> pollen contains 0.7 mcg per 10 g of pollen. The traditional oral dose of pine pollen in China is 4.5 to 9 g per day.</p><p>Amino acid content is high in all pine pollens. For instance, chemical analysis of <i>Pinus montana</i> pollen has found that it contains the following amino acids (amounts shown per 100 grams): arginine (6.4 g), leucine (6.5 g), lysine (5.1 g), methionine (1.5 g), phenylalanine (2.1 g), tryptophane (0.8 g), and tyrosine (1.05 g) plus trace amounts of alanine, amino-butyric acid, aspartic acid, cystine, glutamic acid, glycine, hydroxyproline, isoleucine, proline, serine, threonine, and valine.</p><p>The <i>P. massonia</i> and <i>P. tabulaeformis</i> combination that is often used in Chinese pine pollen tablets contains amino acids that are similar to ones in <i>P. montana,</i> including the following (amounts shown per 100 grams): asparagic acid (1098 mg), threonine (492 mg), serine (522 mg), amino glutaric acid (1579 mg), aminoacetic acid (698 mg), alanine (564 mg), isoleucine (539 mg), leucine (846 mg), tyrosine (365 mg), phenylalanine (572 mg), lysine (802 mg), histidine (189 mg), cystine (112 mg), valine (646 mg), merionin (166 mg), arginine (998 mg), proline (884 mg), and tryptophan (149 mg).</p><p>Phenylalanine is linked with neurotransmitters in the brain and affects mood and dopamine levels in the brain. Both phenylalanine and tyrosine are L-dopa precursors. L-dopa is metabolized into dopamine in both the heart and brain. Without dopamine, neural communication in the brain would be impossible. L-dopa has also been found to increase sexual interest and activity and facilitate erections in men. It is specific for treating anorgasmia, a woman’s inability to have an orgasm. Tyrosine is also the precursor for epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide (an erection stimulant) and possesses wound-healing and immune-enhancing functions (which is why pine pollen is so effective for skin conditions). Arginine boosts the release of growth hormones, improves fertility, and is spermigenic (that is, it increases sperm production) at doses of 4 grams per day.</p><p>Pine pollen has been found to be high in vitamins, too. <i>P. montana</i> contains the following vitamins (amounts shown per gram of pollen): riboflavin (5.6 mg), nicotinic acid (79.8 mg), pantothenic acid (7.8 mg), pyridoxine (3.1 mg), biotin (0.62 mg), inositol (9 mg), and folic acid (0.42 mg).</p><p>Analysis of pine pollen by Chinese researchers has shown similar results. Study has found that it contains (amounts shown per 100 grams): vitamins B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">1</sub> (6070 mcg), B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">2</sub> (486 mcg), B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">6</sub> (1300 mcg), E (3240 mcg), C (562 mcg), D<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">3</sub> (22.8 mcg), and A (43.2 mcg), nicotinamide (24000 mcg), folic acid (930 mcg), and B-carotin (26.2 mcg).</p><p>The amount of vitamin D in <i>P. sylvestris</i> and <i>P. nigra</i> runs about 2 mcg per 10 grams of pollen. Vitamins D<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">2</sub> and D<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">3</sub> are present in amounts of between 0.1 and 3 mcg per 10 g of pollen. The pollen also contains the hydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">3</sub>, which plays an essential role in the regulation of intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption, calcium mobilization from bone, and reabsorption of calcium and phosphorus in the kidneys. It also modulates osteoclast differentiation, suppression of parathyroid cell growth and parathyroid hormone gene expression and effects growth and differentiation of keratinocytes in skin. This explains, in part, the traditional effectiveness of pine pollen in Chinese medicine to treat people with intestinal complaints and, again, skin problems.</p><p>Chinese pine pollen, like all pine pollens, contains numerous essential elements, including the following (amounts shown in parts per million): potassium (3118.8), sodium (516.8), calcium (481), magnesium (1427.5), phosphorus (3609.1), iron (129.9), manganese (280.7), copper (4.3), zinc (9.8), and selenium (0.1). Pine pollens also contain a number of primary constituents. For instance, <i>P. ponderosa</i> contains 11.17 percent fatty substances, 0.23 percent ketose sugar, 1.14 percent glucose, 16.40 percent sucrose, and 1.29 percent starch.</p><p>Most of the scientific studies have been carried out in China. Few of the papers from these studies have been translated into English. In vivo studies with mice have found that Chinese pine pollen has a distinctive antifatigue effect, enhances survival times under stress, increases SOD activity in the liver, protects the liver from chemical stressors including alcohol, reduces cholesterol levels, increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels while reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and protects arterial blood vessels from damage. Other in vivo studies of pine pollen have found that it reduces the build up of lipofuscin in the heart, brain, and liver. Lipofuscin is granules of a brown pigment, considered to be an aging pigment, and is the residue of lysomal digestion. Build up of lipofuscin occurs as animals age, and it interferes with healthy function of the organs in which it congregates. Liver spots, for example, are deposits of lipofuscin in the skin. That pine pollen reduces the buildup of lipofuscin in the heart, brain, and liver does give credence to its long use in China as an antiaging herb.</p><p>None of the human studies have yet been published in English. Pine pollen’s primary use in Chinese medicine has been as an antiaging medicinal that increases male vitality and potency, mental clarity, strength, skin quality, and agility.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Tincture: One full dropper (30 drops, 1.5 mL, or ⅜ tsp.) three times daily or as desired. The tincture is available through 
<a href="http://www.woodlandessence.com">www.woodlandessence.com</a>. Tablets: three to six ½ g tablets three times daily (that is, 4.5 to 9 g daily). See Resources and Sources of Supply section for sources.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Impacts/Importance of Tincture:</b> I have used pine pollen tincture since 2002 and found it extremely effective in practice. When taken as a tincture, the pollen constituents enter the bloodstream almost immediately. There is an immediate upsurge in energy and, over time, an increase in strength, vitality, libido, and optimism. Sexual stamina and erectile function both increase. These effects are commonly reported among users. I am unclear as to whether the androgens in pine pollen tablets will actually enter the bloodstream as effectively, due to the problems that sometimes occur from constituents having to go through digestion and pass through stomach and GI tract membranes. The digestive process sometimes significantly interferes with some constituent absorption. For that reason I think that the tablets are excellent as a supplement on a daily basis but for testosterone enhancement the tincture is a better approach.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Although uncommon, a small percentage of people are allergic to pine pollen. This runs from 1.5 to 10 percent of the population depending on the geographic location. Allergies are usually mild, running from rhinoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the nose and area around the eyeball) to mild asthma in extremely susceptible people. There is one case of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) to pine nuts in the literature, but such severe effects have not been reported in people using pollen. If you have shown previous sensitivity to pollens, it makes sense to go slow with pine pollen, beginning with a tiny dose, until you are sure that you are not sensitive. <b>If you have a history of allergies to pollen or severe reactions to bee stings, you should proceed with caution to make sure that your reactions do not extend to pine products.</b></p><p>Extensive in vivo toxicological tests in China have shown that pine pollen is not toxic, even at large doses. It has traditionally been used as a permanent adjunct to the diet in both China and Korea. Government publications and the historical literature list no side effects.</p><p>Pine pollen should not be used for enhancing testosterone levels by adolescent men as it may interfere with the body’s normal testosterone production. It should not be used by people with conditions of androgenic excess.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>David’s Lily <i>(Lilium davidii)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Liliaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> David’s lily, chuan bai he (China).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> For food, the root bulb. For androgen enhancement, primarily the anthers and pollen, however the whole flower is generally harvested and tinctured for use.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Habitat:</b> This lily is native to China (Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces), and the Indian subcontinent (states of Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur). Flower fanciers, however, have spread it around the world, and it is becoming naturalized everywhere. The plant grows 3 to 5 feet tall; the bright orange, black-spotted flowers grow singly or two to eight in a raceme. The plants like moist places in forests, forest margins, and grassy slopes, generally at elevations of 2,400 feet or higher. The plant is widely cultivated in China for its edible bulbs.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Cultivation:</b> Usually from bulbs, like most members of this family.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection:</b> Generally, the flowers are collected when they are mature and the pollen is well developed. The bulbs are usually harvested in autumn or winter. See the Scientific heading in this section for more on collecting this species for use in enhancing androgens in men.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Androgenic stimulant, relaxant.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Chemistry:</b> Although extensive chemical profiles have been developed on many similar lilies, this species is very new to that type of examination. The chemistry of the lily family is complex, and steroidal compounds are common, including steroidal saponins, steroidal alkaloids, and now, in this species, steroidal hormones. All of these have impacts on human physiology.</p><p>Research on David’s lily has found a number of integrin-like proteins, alpha-actinin-like proteins, F-actin, and G-actin. Beta-sitosterol, emodin, and stigmasterol are common in the plant. Of more interest for androgen supplementation is the research showing testosterone in the plant. Parts of the plant also contain estrogens, so the plant must be harvested at a specific time so that testosterone level is maximized.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About David’s Lily:</b> David’s lily is widely cultivated in China for its edible bulbs. It has been an integral food plant there for millennia.</p><p>Native Americans, the Greeks and Romans, Europeans and the Chinese have all regularly eaten different species of lilies. Thoreau in his journal commented in July 1857 that he “dug some, and found a mass of bulbs pretty deep in the earth, two inches in diameter, looking and even tasting somewhat like raw green corn on the ear.”</p><p>The lily family is large and contains 294 genera and some 4,500 species of herbs. Garlic and onion, <i>Alium</i> species, are members of the lily family, and like most lilies possess edible bulbs—what we call onions and garlic cloves. Like onions and garlic, the bulbs of lilies are pungent and are rarely eaten fresh. They are almost always cooked, usually baked or boiled. As with onions and garlic this softens the pungent nature of the plants and, for many types of edible lilies, makes them a delicious food.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> Unknown as far as I can determine.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> The Chinese more often use the bulb as a nutritive and medicinal food than they do the flowers. Usually the root is baked or boiled, sometimes stuffed with a blend of pork, onions, and garlic.</p><p>In traditional Chinese practice the bulb has been used for coughs and sore throats, to clear the lungs, for low-grade fever, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, and for calming the spirit. Throughout Asia, the flower has been used as a relaxant for the nerves and a general, strengthening tonic.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> David’s lily is unknown in historical Western practice. However, other species of lily have extensive historical presence in Western botanic practice and have been used externally for bruises, boils, corns, burns, ulcers, inflammations, and softening hard skin. Internally they were used as anodynes (soothing pain), anti-epileptics, and relaxing nervines. Lily species are used as diuretics (promoting urine flow), for dropsy (i.e., the accumulation of water in the lower extremities from a poorly functioning heart), and for strengthening the heart.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Modern analysis has found significant levels of testosterone in the anther (part that produces pollen) and pollen of David’s lily, making it one of a handful of plants known, at this point, to possess testosterone as a constituent.</p><p>The testosterone in the plant is present in substantial quantities at only one time. That is when the anthers are producing pollen and just before pollen release. Levels of testosterone increase as the anthers’ production of pollen comes into play then reach a maximum at anthesis (when the flower is in full bloom and the pollen is just about to be released for germination). After pollen shedding, testosterone levels drop rapidly. After pollination, as the testosterone levels drop, estrogen levels in the plant increase substantially. The plant is very time sensitive in this respect.</p><p>No clinical research has been done with this species of lily that I can find. I have used a tincture of the flowering plant and found it useful but with effects that were not as strong as those of pine pollen.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Availability:</b> Woodland Essence, a natural medicine company, has been working on growing David’s lily; I am not sure that they are producing sufficient quantities for production. The plant is primarily included in this book to try and stimulate more production of phytoandrogens by American herbal growers.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> The flowers at peak pollen production should be tinctured in alcohol. Tincture: ¼ tsp. three times daily.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Begin with extremely low doses and work up.

Not for those with androgenic excess conditions.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Ginseng <i>(Panax ginseng)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Araliaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> Ginseng, panax, Asian ginseng, Chinese ginseng, Korean ginseng, Korean red, renshen (China).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> Both the root and, sometimes, the above-ground plant. The above-ground plant, though weaker in its effects, does possess many of the same actions as the root. Use of the plant rather than the root is more ecologically sustainable. Ginseng is a perennial.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Habitat:</b> Asian ginseng is native to China, Korea, and Russia, where it grows in regions very similar to the Appalachian and Ozark mountain ranges of the United States. Most of it is grown on the mountain slopes of China’s northeastern ranges and in adjacent regions of Korea and Russia. Due to heavy medicinal use in China over thousands of years, the wild plant is exceptionally rare, and most Asian ginseng is now farm-raised. The older the roots, the stronger and more potent their chemistries.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection:</b> Generally, ginseng roots are not harvested until at least the fifth year as research has shown that the ginsenoide content (perhaps the most important active constituent) of the roots becomes high at that time. The root also doubles in weight by the sixth year, making harvest at that time more profitable.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Adaptogenic, corticosteroidogenic, gonadotrophic, antifatigue, cardiotonic, hypoglycemic, hypothalamic tonic, pituitary stimulant, cognitive stimulant, central nervous system activator (thymoleptic), tonic and restorative, antitumor, immune stimulant, stomachic. Used in cases of weakness, loss of vitality, anemia, forgetfulness, and impotence.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Chemistry:</b> The constituents of ginseng include twenty-eight different ginsenosides as well as polyacetylenes, alkaloids, polysaccharides, essential oils, fatty acids, steroids, amino acids, peptides, nucleotides, vitamins, choline, starch, pectins, and cellulose.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Ginseng:</b> The Asian species has been used for millennia in China; the American species by indigenous people for just as long. It is probably the only herb that nearly everyone in the United States has heard of. Often overused, overpriced, and oversold—still, when used for the right conditions, the results are exceptional.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> A related species, <i>P. fruticosum,</i> has been used in Ayurvedic practice, but uncommonly.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> Chinese physicians have been using ginseng for at least two thousand years, the earliest mention occurring in medical texts in the first century. The Chinese process Asian ginseng in at least fifteen different ways, the two most common being “white” and “red” ginseng. “White” ginseng is the whole, carefully dried root. “Red” ginseng is processed by steaming the roots for three hours, drying them over a low fire, and compressing them into bricks of specific weight. Red ginseng is hard, brittle, almost glasslike, with a red, translucent look to it. When powdering for use as a tincture or to encapsulate, it sounds almost like broken glass in the blender. While possessing similar medicinal activities, there are slight differences between the two forms of Asian ginseng. Red, for example, shows more antioxidant activity. There are significant differences between American ginseng <i>(P. quinque</i><i>folius)</i> and Asian ginseng <i>(P. ginseng).</i> The Chinese consider American ginseng more <i>yin</i> (female, cool, soft, yielding) and Asian ginseng more <i>yang</i> (male, hot, hard, aggressive). (Tienchi ginseng, on the other hand, is considered neutral, evenly balanced between yin and yang.) Scientific research has born this out in a number of ways, the most basic being that American ginseng contains the female hormone estradiol, an estrogen, while Asian ginseng does not.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Known but not generally used in early American practice. At that time, the emphasis was on American ginseng, <i>P. quinquefolia</i>. In Germany, Asian ginseng is now part of standard practice medicine and it is widely known throughout the Western countries. It often is used to promote male health and vitality. Too often, though, it is misused as a stimulant; it stimulates adrenal production through ginsenoside corticosteroid activation.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> More than three thousand scientific studies have been conducted on Asian ginseng over the past fifty years. The online database Medline alone lists 2,530 studies. In China, there are hundreds or thousands more that have not yet been translated into English. The kind of research that has been done has often differed depending on the country of origin. Steven Foster notes in <i>Herbal Emissaries</i> that, “Chinese researchers, as is the case with medicinal plants in general, have focused on <i>how</i> ginseng works, whereas western researchers focus on <i>if</i> it works . . . In Asia, the efficacy of an herb is already established in a cultural context. In the West we presuppose that traditional or folk uses have no rational scientific basis.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr21"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt21">1</a></sup></p><p>Still, a great deal of important research has been done. As Foster goes on to note, Asian ginseng has been found to possess “radioprotective, antitumor, antiviral, and metabolic effects; antioxidant activities, nervous system and reproductive performance [effects]; effects on cholesterol and lipid metabolism; and endocrinological activity.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr22"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt22">2</a></sup> It is an adaptogen (increasing general strength and resistance to stress), an antifatigue, stimulates the adrenal cortex (corticosteroidogenic), supports skin regeneration, and has hypoglycemic activity. The science is not in doubt except to die-hard pharmaceutical and medical reductionists. What is most important are the studies supporting its use for balancing androgen shifts, for helping with many of the common problems men experience in middle age, especially reproductive problems.</p><p>European clinical studies have shown consistent shortening of reaction time to visual and auditory stimuli, heightened alertness, increased concentration, increased mental clarity, better grasp of abstract concepts, heightened visual and motor coordination, and stronger respiration after the use of Asian ginseng. Research shows clear activity for male reproductive systems. A few examples:</p><p>In one human trial with a saponin fraction (a constituent) of Asian ginseng in which volunteers took 4 grams per day for three months, researchers found that the men showed an increase of plasma testosterone, DHT, FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), number of sperm, and sperm motility. Luteinizing hormone stimulates the synthesis and secretion of testosterone into the bloodstream. Follicle stimulating hormone is critical for sperm production. It supports the function of the testes’ Sertoli cells and thus stimulates the maturation and health of sperm. Russian researchers found in a number of clinical studies that ginseng is effective for impotence in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Two Russian clinical trials (of forty-four and twenty-seven men respectively) on the use of ginseng for impotence found that half the men recovered completely, the others improved.</p><p>In vivo studies (in living animals—rats and mice usually) have consistently shown increases in their levels of testosterone after powdered ginseng root was included in their diet, mixed with food. Both in vivo and in vitro (in lab glassware) studies show that ginseng and the ginsenosides present in Asian ginseng stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone as strongly as the luteinizing release hormone (called gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH) produced by the body. This release of LH stimulates the male body to increase levels of testosterone. Numerous in vivo studies have shown that the herb stimulates sexual behavior, increases sperm counts and motility, and increases protein synthesis in the testes. The action appears to come primarily from a gonadotrophic action, that is it either mimics or stimulates the release of gonadotrophin (a sexually specific hormone) from the pituitary gland. In general, ginseng is considered to be a substance that stimulates the testes to produce more testosterone and sperm rather than being a substance that adds testosterone to the body.</p><p>Ginseng is also corticosteroidogenic, that is, it stimulates the release of cortisol and adrenaline from the adrenal glands. Too much of the herb can be, well, too much. This is why some of the side effects from overuse and overdosage occur. (See the Side Effects in this section.)</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Asian ginseng can be taken as tablets for 1 to 9 grams per day or as a tincture. The tincture is prepared in a 1:5 mixture in 70 percent alcohol. The normal American dosage range is: Kirin (dark red): 5 to 20 drops per day. White: 20 to 40 drops per day. Asians often consume it in much higher dosages.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Note:</b> For androgen-replacement purposes, Asian ginseng should be used and <i>not</i> American ginseng. I generally prefer to combine Asian ginseng with Tienchi ginseng (see next listing) when using it for antifatigue actions. In such cases, I use a combination of Tienchi (tinctured 1:5, 70% alcohol) and Asian ginseng tinctures, half and half, ⅓ tsp. per day in water.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Availability:</b> Asian ginseng in many forms is widely available at health food stores and on the Internet.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Ginseng can be quite stimulating and should be used in small doses at first, and the dosage increased once you are used to it. It can sometimes cause hypertension, especially with large, sustained doses, and is contraindicated for those with extremely elevated blood pressure. It can be used with care in mild hypertension and with oversight in moderate hypertension. Sustained overuse can cause insomnia, sometimes heart palpitations, muscle tension, and headache. It may cause difficulty in sleeping if taken before bedtime.</p><p>Because ginseng affects androgen and testosterone levels, it should not be used by adolescent men. Not for use in androgenic excess conditions, not for use during pregnancy.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Ginseng should be avoided by people who are taking the drugs warfarin (Coumadin), phenelzine (Nardil), digoxin (Lanoxin), or haloperidol (Haldol). It should also be avoided by people who are taking hypoglycemic drugs, anticoagulants, or adrenal stimulants. Caution should be exercised in its use with MAO inhibitors. Ginseng may block the painkilling actions of morphine.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Tienchi Ginseng <i>(Panax notoginseng,</i></b></p><p class="ctx1s"><b><i>P.</i> <i>pseudoginseng var. notoginseng)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Araliaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> Tienchi ginseng, san qi, tan qi</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Habitat:</b> This type of ginseng is native to northern India, Nepal, southern China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan. It likes the woods, much like American and Asian ginsengs. It looks, in fact, very similar to Asian ginseng.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Cultivation:</b> From seed.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection:</b> In the fall, after seeding.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Adaptogen, gonadotrophic, immune stimulant, blood tonic, antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory, antihemorrhagic, cardioprotective, hypocholesterolemic. Enhances sperm motility, stimulates production and release of nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase. This latter action helps to expand coronary arteries to promote blood circulation and prevent blood clots. This also makes it a useful erection aid because erections are highly dependent on nitric oxide production.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Chemistry:</b> Contains fourteen ginsenosides as well as flavonoids, B-sitosterol, daucosterol, numerous alkaloids, flavonol glycosides, various saponins, glycans, polysaccharide fraction DPG-3–2, peptides, (20)-protopanaxatriol, (20)-protopanaxadiol, panaxynal, quercitin, numerous polysaccharides, eight arasapogenins, and a number of vitamins and minerals, including A, B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">6</sub>, and zinc. The arasapogenins are considered to be structurally similar to the ginsenosides and are sometimes referred to as notoginsenosides. The notoginsenosides are unique to tienchi ginseng, and their actions have not yet been explored fully.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Tienchi Ginseng:</b> Although tienchi and Asian ginseng do have many ginsenosides in common, ginseng has more, about twenty-eight to tienchi’s fourteen. Tienchi, as well, has its own unique compounds, the notoginsenosides. So, while there is some overlap in function, each plant has a unique chemical profile that produces unique actions in the body. I like tienchi for men because of its impacts on blood circulation, the heart, nitric oxide production, sperm production and motility, and erectile function.</p><p>In traditional Chinese use, tienchi ginseng has been known primarily for its actions in the cardiovascular system. However, its ginsenosides as well as the notoginsenosides that are unique to tienchi ginseng have steroidal-like impacts on male physiology. Many of them are considered to be gonadotrophic, that is they stimulate the testes to produce more testosterone and sperm. Sperm motility is enhanced, and the body produces more nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, which is an enzyme that acts in the body to produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is involved in many physiological processes, including blood pressure control, neurotransmission, learning, and memory. In high concentrations it acts as a defensive cytotoxin—part of the immune response to disease. Nitric oxide is especially important for men’s erections, it works to stimulate blood vessel expansion and blood flow in the heart and penis.</p><p>One of the reasons the herb works so well for preventing and correcting heart conditions is that it stimulates the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells in the blood. A form of stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells are formed in the bone marrow. One of their main functions is to repair damage to the lining of blood vessels. The higher the count of these cells in the blood, the lower the incidence of disease. The number of endothelial progenitor cells tends to be low in people with multivessel disease, diabetes, a history of heart attack, and atherosclerosis. Tienchi ginseng’s stimulation of these cells is significant.</p><p>Tienchi ginseng can be purchased as a whole dried root, a sliced dried root, or a prepared root. The prepared root is generally small, black, and marble-sized, with the same glasslike properties as kirin red ginseng. I have generally used the prepared root to enhance health, vitality, and male reproduction. The whole and sliced roots are sometimes used in China as a food, generally steamed. The steamed root is sometimes dried and encapsulated as well. In Chinese practice, the steamed root is considered to be more of a system tonic, while the unsteamed root is considered better for treating the blood.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> A related species, <i>P. fruticosum,</i> has been used in Ayurvedic practice but is uncommon.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> A relative newcomer to Chinese practice, tienchi ginseng has only been in use for five hundred years. Its primary use is for the blood, heart, and circulatory system. The herb is used primarily for blood stasis and improper blood conditions. It is specific for serious bleeding and traumatic shock.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Unknown until recent introduction from China and Japan, it is beginning to be well established in Western practice.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Compared with Asian ginseng, tienchi is a relative newcomer to scientific study. There are only four or five hundred studies on record, about 240 of them in the online Medline database. However, examination of the plant has found the same ginsenosides (though fewer of them) as those in Asian ginseng.</p><p>In hundreds of studies, researchers have consistently found that ginsenosides have active pharmacological effects in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous systems. Ginsenosides have been found to have anticarcinogenic effects through a number of different mechanisms—either by direct cytotoxic effects or by induction of differentiation and inhibition of metastasis. Ginsenosides and notoginsenosides also have a number of specific actions in the central nervous system and brain. Ginsenoside Rg1, for example, modulates neurotransmission and prevents chemically-induced memory deficits by increasing cholinergic activity. This same compound also has immunomodulating effects, increasing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.</p><p>Scores of in vivo studies in China have found tienchi to have profound positive effects on the cardiovascular system, especially in the treatment of myocardial infarction, angina, and narrowing of blood vessels. Further tests found that it shortens blood-clotting time and is a strong anti-inflammatory.</p><p>Clinical trials of patients with coronary artery disease found significant improvements with use of the herb, angina decreased in frequency and intensity. Other clinical trials treating hemoptysis (blood from the lungs) were effective as well, with interior bleeding completely arrested. Both hematuria (blood clots resulting from head injury) and intraocular hemorrhage have responded to the herb in clinical trials. The herb is exceptionally good if there are blood clots from traumatic injury.</p><p>Some concern has been raised in the use of this herb as an androgenic supplement because of the presence of ginsenoside Rg1, which is a tremendously potent phytoestrogen. Although that compound <i>is</i> present in the plant, the whole plant itself, when used as a supplement, does not produce estrogenic outcomes because there are scores of other compounds involved, not just this isolated constituent. There is a synergistic effect that occurs when the herb is taken whole.</p><p>Clinical use has been consistent. The herb enhances energy levels, increases mental clarity, helps with libido, erection, sperm motility, and vitality.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 1:5 tincture, 30 drops (1.5 mL or ⅜ tsp.) three times daily. In severe depletion conditions the dose may be increased to twice that amount but side effects should be monitored. <b>Note:</b> For male health, as an antifatigue agent, and testosterone enhancement, I prefer to combine tienchi and Asian ginseng. I generally use a combination of Tienchi (tinctured 1:5, 70% alcohol) and Asian ginseng tinctures, half and half, taking ⅓ tsp. per day in water.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Tienchi ginseng can produce allergic reactions in a small percentage of users. Generally these manifest as some sort of rash—hives, red papules, skin itching, flushed skin. Very rarely, there can be mild anaphylaxis, abdominal pain or swelling, and diarrhea. These reactions are uncommon, with only about nineteen reported instances in the literature out of millions of users.</p><p>High doses of tienchi ginseng can cause nervousness, sleeplessness, anxiety, breast pain, headaches, high blood pressure, insomnia, and restlessness. The plant is a corticosteroidogenic herb, that is, it stimulates the production of catabolic steroids such as adrenaline and cortisol by the adrenal glands.</p><p>The herb should be discontinued at least seven days prior to surgery because ginseng can lower blood glucose level and act as a blood thinner. It should not be used during pregnancy because some of its constituents can cross from breast milk into nursing children. (These conditions correct upon discontinuance of the herb.) It should not be used by adolescent men because it can interfere with the body’s normal testosterone production. It should not be used by people with conditions of androgenic excess.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Do not use with blood thinning agents, warfarin (may decrease effectiveness). It may and probably will increase the effects of amphetamine-like stimulants, including caffeine. Do not use with haloperidol, an antipsychotic, it may exaggerate its effects. Tienchi may block the effects of morphine, and its use with MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine may cause symptoms such as headaches, manic episodes, and tremulousness.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Eleuthero aka Siberian Ginseng <i>(Eleutherococcus senticosus, Acanthopanax senticosus)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Araliaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> Siberian ginseng, eleuthero, ci-wu-jia (China), devil’s shrub, touch-me-not (Russia).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> The cortex (outer layer) of the root, the whole root, and the bark.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Cultivation:</b> From seeds.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Siberian ginseng, a persistent, aggressive shrub from 3 to 15 feet in height, grows throughout parts of China, Russia, Korea, and even a bit in the northern islands of Japan. It is covered with spines and has an aggressive, intimidating presence that has given rise to some of its common Russian names—touch-me-not and devil’s shrub.</p><p>Due to its popularity as a medicinal, it is undergoing heavy planting in the United States and has begun to escape captivity. Soon it will be, like a number of important medicinals, among them Japanese knotweed, a naturalized, aggressive weed with qualities unknown to those it irritates.</p><p>The bark is generally harvested in late summer or fall; the roots when the plant goes dormant in late fall. In China only the cortex, or outer layer, of the root is used while in Russia they use the whole root. In the United States we tend to follow the Russian lead and use the whole root. When purchased, the root usually has been cut and sifted or powdered to industry standards. Adulteration of Chinese imports is a problem. North American-grown eleuthero is generally more reliable.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Mild androgen, adaptogen, antistressor, immune tonic (or stimulant depending on preparation), immune-potentiator (increases nonspecific immunity), immunoadjuvant, adrenal tonic, increases nonspecific resistance against a number of pathogens, cardiotonic, antirheumatic, increases cerebral blood flow, dilates blood vessels, and is a MAO inhibitor.

It was brought to prominence as an immune tonic and adaptogen as a result of intensive Russian research in the latter half of the twentieth century (and has now traveled back to China as an adaptogenic herb).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> Unknown.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> Eleuthero has been used in Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years. It is considered good for vital energy, strengthening the spleen and kidney, for deficiency of yang in the spleen and kidney, and for stabilizing energy.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Unknown until the Russian research brought it to prominence in the late twentieth century. Now it is a staple in the Western herbal pharmacopoeia.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Eleuthero contains two known androgenic substances: eleutheroside-B-1 and eleutheroside-E. Preliminary work on the effects of the herb on male reproductive health has shown that it increases the weight of prostate and seminal vesicles in castrated rats (118% and 70%, respectively) and that it also prevents the atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles if given to rats before castration. Essentially, eleuthero can keep levels of male androgens high enough that even when the primary source of testosterone is lost through castration, the rest of the sexual organs remain normal.</p><p>A number of clinical trials have shown significant immune-enhancing activity, including significant increases in immunocompetent cells, specifically T-lymphocytes (helper/inducers, cytotoxic and natural killer cells). Tests of the herb have repeatedly shown that it increases the ability of human beings to withstand adverse conditions, increases mental alertness, and improves performance. People taking the herb consistently report fewer illnesses than those who do not take the herb. Part of its power is its ability to act as a tonic stimulant on the adrenal glands. It normalizes adrenal activity and moves adrenal action away from a cortisol/catabolic dynamic to a DHEA/anabolic orientation. Basically, this reduces stress and normalizes physiological functioning throughout the body.</p><p>In one Russian clinical trial, 2,100 healthy adults were given the herb and found to better handle stressful conditions. They showed increased ability to perform physical labor, withstand motion sickness, and work with speed and precision despite loud surroundings. Their ability to accurately proofread documents increased, and they more readily adapted to diverse physical stresses, including high altitudes, heat, and low-oxygen environments.</p><p>Another Russian study of 13,000 auto workers found that those who took the herb developed 40 percent fewer respiratory infections than normal for their group.</p><p>Other studies have found that the herb heightens mental alertness, improves concentration, and boosts the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain.</p><p><i>Eleutherococcus senticosus</i> and a related species, <i>E. chiisanensis,</i> have been found to be strongly antihepatotoxic and hepatoprotective in vivo against CCL4-induced hepatotoxicity. (In other words, they strongly protect the liver from damage by toxins and chemicals.) Additionally, eleuthero has been found to be a hepatoregenerator, significantly stimulating liver regeneration in animals with portions of their livers surgically removed.</p><p>Because the herb is a MAO inhibitor, it is also useful in depression, a condition that often accompanies a severely depleted immune system and chronic liver disease.</p><p>These overall effects make eleuthero a good herb for men experiencing low libido, loss of energy, or problems with androgen levels in middle age.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Most of the Russian studies were conducted using a 1:1 tincture with 30 to 33 percent alcohol. The Russians generally dosed 2 to 16 mL one to three times each day for sixty days with a two- to three-week rest period in between. Ill patients received less, 0.5 to 6 mL one to three times per day for three days, then a two- to three-week rest period in between. At these kinds of dosages, Russian researchers saw responses within a few days or even hours of administration. Some of the American companies that utilize the Russian approach for tincturing also like to standardize their formulas for specific eleutheroside content. Tinctures that, like the Russian formulations, are 1:1 or 1:2 are black in color (in contrast to 1:5 formulations, which are golden). Remember to look for a black tincture to ensure that it is a 1:1 or 1:2 formulation.</p><p>I suggest the product made by Herb Pharm, which is the only company I know of that actually exceeds the Russian specifications. Their formula is a 2:1 tincture (two parts herb to one part liquid) rather than a 1:1 tincture. For the first thirty to sixty days: 1 tsp. of the tincture three times daily, the last dose occurring by 4 p.m. This amount can be increased if necessary. Discontinue the herb for two weeks. Repeat the course if necessary. If symptoms decrease after using the Russian formulation and immune function seems better, the type of formulation used can change to either an encapsulated form or a 1:5 alcohol/water tincture (one part herb to five parts liquid). Both these formulations are weaker than the Russian approach.</p><p>As an encapsulated form, I suggest a 450 mg capsule of a formulation standardized to 0.8 percent eleutherosides B&amp;E, particularly Nature’s Way capsules, which contain 250 mg of standardized extract and 200 mg of the whole herb. Take two capsules four times daily for the eight to twelve months of treatment.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Alternate Preparations:</b> Although I prefer the Russian formulation for androgen enhancement and to treat severe chronic diseases like Lyme borreliosis and chronic fatigue, I generally use and prefer a weaker tincture for people with general weakness and fatigue, as do many American herbalists. People with these conditions should take a full dropper (30 drops) of a 1:5, 60-percent alcohol tincture one to three times each day for up to a year. In my experience, this dosage and use pattern is less stimulating to the system and the long-term effects are better. The body gradually uses the herb to build itself up over time, the herb acting more as a long-term tonic and rejuvenative than an active stimulant. With this type of tincture, it is not necessary to stop every one to two months, nor have I seen any of the side effects that can occur with the stronger Russian formulation.</p><p>The Chinese, much less given to tincturing anyway, use 4.5 to 27 g, often as a decoction or powder.</p><p>Tinctures, tablets, and capsules are widely available at health food stores and on the Internet.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>For Increasing Androgen Levels:</b> If your libido and energy levels are low, then the Russian formulation is going to be the most effective form of the herb to take. The Herb Pharm product is the best for this.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Eleuthero is, in general, completely nontoxic and the Russians have reported taking exceptionally large doses for up to twenty years with no adverse reactions. The lower strength 1:5 formula rarely shows any side effects at all, most side effects refer to the 1:1 or 1:2 formulas and even for these formulations most people experience no side effects.</p><p>Contraindicated in pregnancy. Insomnia and hyperactivity can occur with use of the stronger Russian formulation especially when taken in large doses, with caffeine, or late in the afternoon or evening. A very small number of people have experienced transient diarrhea. May temporarily increase blood pressure in some people. This tends to drop to normal within a few weeks. Caution should be exercised for people with very high blood pressure especially if combined with other hypertensives such as licorice. With extreme overuse: tension and insomnia.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> 1:1 or 1:2 formulas—should not be used by people who are taking digoxin or sedatives, especially barbiturates such as pentobarbital.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Nettle Root <i>(Urtica dioica)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Urticaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> To increase testosterone levels and for prostate health, the root; for gout, the plant; for arthritis, the plant and its “sting;” and for kidney health, the seeds.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Nettles grow throughout the world, the root can be harvested at any time but is often picked in the spring before the nettles and their stings are much advanced.

Although it is used rarely, its applications are similar to those of European folk practice.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> Not a part of traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Has been used since the dawn of time.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Of most importance in helping raise testosterone levels, nettle root has been found to inhibit the binding of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in human trial, thus keeping body levels of androgens higher. A general inhibition of SHBG binding has been found in other human studies and in a great many in vitro studies with human cells. Nettle root also possesses strong antiaromatase action, thus interfering with the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This has been found to occur in the human placenta, in animal studies, and in vitro. Nettle root is specifically indicated if you suffer both BPH and low testosterone levels.</p><p>Nettle root possesses powerful tonic actions for the male prostate. It has been used to treat both BPH and prostatitis in at least thirty clinical studies. Participants in the studies ranged from as few as twenty men to as many as 5,400. In men with Stage I to III BPH, nettle root consistently reduced nocturia (nighttime urination), improved urine stream, decreased urine remaining in the bladder after urination, and decreased prostate size. Its use also resulted in significantly lower scores on the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire, which rates the degree of negative impacts on urination from prostate inflammation in seven areas plus overall quality of life. A number of the trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies.</p><p>A few examples:</p><p>From 61 to 83 percent of 5,492 men who used 1200 mg of nettle root daily for three to four months found significant relief from BPH symptoms.</p><p>In twenty-six men who used 1200 mg of nettle root daily, prostate volume decreased in 54 percent and residual volume of urine in seventy-five percent.</p><p>Seventy-nine men who used 600 mg of nettle root per day for sixty-eight weeks (sixteen months) found that urine flow significantly increased and urination time significantly decreased.</p><p>Twenty patients who used a combination of nettle root and saw palmetto in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial found that their flow rate significantly improved over placebo. Their International Prostate Symptom Score results declined from 18.6 to 11.1 and with continued use further declined to 9.8. The study found that continued use of the herbs increased prostate shrinkage over time, improving prostate health the longer they are used. The same study compared 489 men with others using finasteride (Proscar) over a forty-eight week period and found that International Prostate Symptom Score results dropped similarly in both groups but that the men using herbal extracts had fewer side effects.</p><p>Needle biopsies were taken in a number of studies to discover exactly what was happening to the prostate in men taking nettle root. Researchers found that nettle root reduced the activity of the smooth muscle cells in the prostate, caused shrinkage of the epithelial or glandular tissue, and increased epithelial secretions.</p><p>Nettle root has been found to be consistently anti-inflammatory (both to the prostate and other tissues), to inhibit production of SHBG, to inhibit the binding of DHT to SHBG, and to be antiaromatasic (inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estradiol).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> The dosage varies depending on what kind of nettle preparation you buy.</p><p>The capsule dosage ranges from 300 to 1200 mg per day of nettle root for three to twelve months in the majority of the clinical trials. This generally is the preferred form for male reproductive health.</p><p>The tincture dosage range is from 30 to 150 drops (1 to 5 full droppers, ⅜ to 2 tsp.) daily of a 45 percent alcohol/water tincture for one to twelve months.</p><p>Make sure in buying capsules and tinctures that you get preparations made from nettle root and <i>not</i> the plant because each is used to treat different conditions.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Mild side effects have occasionally been reported with the root, usually mild gastrointestinal upset. With the plant, only mild side effects have been noted, including skin afflictions such as rashes and mild swelling. The Physicians Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines lists a contraindication for the plant in cases of people with fluid retention from reduced cardiac or renal action. No contraindications are noted for the root.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> There is a slight possibility that the use of nettle root can decrease the effects of anticoagulants.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Tribulus <i>(Tribulus terrestris)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Zygophyllaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Common Names:</b> Tribulus, puncture vine, caltrop, cat’s head, devil’s thorn, devil’s weed, goat head, ji li (China), gokhru (India), and a variety of local insulting names and epithets, depending on location and degree of damage to persons and property.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> Usually the dried fruit is used, especially to enhance fertility, although the leafy plant and root are also effective and sometimes used medicinally as well.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Tribulus is a relatively small, low, weedy, shrubby, vine, sort-of-innocuous, nasty-looking plant that is widely distributed naturally in Asia throughout the tropics and subtropics, including Africa and Australia. It has also, happily, naturalized throughout much of the world, especially in California and parts of the American West. The root may be picked at any time, the plant when mature, and the fruit when ripe.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Reproductive and urinary tonic, antilithic (prohibiting or reducing kidney stones), hypotensive, diuretic, demulcent, aphrodisiac, DHEA production stimulant, and cardiac tonic for angina pectoris. The stems are considered to be a reliable astringent.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Chemistry:</b> The fruits contain a number of alkaloids and saponins, some of them steroidal in nature. A number of researchers think that compounds they have dubbed furostanol saponins are the active constituents. Time will tell, as the plant is loaded with active compounds. These include beta-sitosterol, campesterol, 25-D-spirosta-3,5-diene, aspartic acid, astragalin, calcium, chlorogenic, cracillin, daucosterol, desoxydiogenin, diosgenin, diosgin, gitogenin, glutamic acid, harman, harmine, hecogenin, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-0-glucoside, kaempferol-3-0rutinoside, kaempferol-3-beta-d-glucoside, linoleic acid, neogitogenin, neohecogenin glucopyranoside, oleic acid, palmitic acid, protodioscin, quercetin, ruscogenin, rutin, saponoside-c, stearic acid, stigmasterol, terrestroside, tribuloside, tribulosin, and so on.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Tribulus:</b> Tribulus is considered a noxious weed by many Westerners, especially those occupying Australia. Asians seem more understanding, perhaps because of their long use of the herb in traditional medicine. Called puncture vine for a reason, the spiny seeds are ferocious and nearly impossible to remove once embedded. They can puncture feet, animal paws, and bicycle tires with equal impunity.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Ayurvedic Use:</b> In traditional Ayurvedic and Unani practice, tribulus has been used for at least three thousand years for the treatment of kidney stones, to increase urine and semen production, and as an aphrodisiac.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine:</b> Used for some four hundred years in Chinese medicine, tribulus is used for headaches, vertigo, dizziness, red, swollen and painful eyes, eye tearing, skin lesions, itching and hives, impotence, spermatorrhea, and pain in the loins.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Western Botanic Practice:</b> Westerners, coming along some three millennia later than practitioners in India and using an entirely different approach, are finding the plant useful for: reducing kidney stones, increasing urine production, increasing semen production and sperm motility, and increasing sexual drive and performance. The actions of tribulus on the mucous membranes of the urinary tract are toning, astringent, and antibacterial, similar in action to that of buchu and uva ursi, two other well-known urinary system tonics.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Scientific Research:</b> Studies have shown that tribulus increases serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to higher levels of testosterone. Other studies have found consistently increased sexual drive in men who take the herb. And yet others showed a significant increase of DHEAS (a slightly different form of DHEA) in men’s urine after they used tribulus for three weeks. Overall, tribulus is a useful herb for increasing testosterone levels and rebalancing the androgen/estrogen ratio. It is specifically indicated if you suffer from low sperm count and low sperm motility (or erectile dysfunction) and low serum testosterone levels. The herb shows a profound impact on male reproductive health, especially sperm production and motility.</p><p>Clinical study has found that from 50 to 80 percent of people using standardized preparations of tribulus experience significantly improved sperm production and motility. One study noted that taking 500 mg of tribulus three times a day for sixty days significantly increased sperm production for men diagnosed with idiopathic oligozoospermia (men who show no sperm in the semen from no discernable cause). Libido, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm all increased significantly for 80 percent of the men. Another, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed significant increases in sperm motility with corresponding decreases in immotile sperm. Numerous other studies have shown similar outcomes. Tribulus has been found to increase the production of LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and, interestingly, estradiol in women and testosterone in men but not vice versa. This indicates it is a general reproductive system adaptogen and tonic, rather than specific to gender. Follicle stimulating hormone is critical for sperm production. It supports the testes’ Sertoli cells and stimulates the production and maturation of sperm. A listing of relevant studies can be found in the Tribulus section in the Bibliography.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> A number of researchers and clinicians feel that the herb should be standardized for what they call furostanol saponin content, and some companies do so between 40 and 45 percent furostanols. It is available under a number of brand names: Tribestan, Trilovin, Libilov, and so on, and can be easily found on the Internet and in many health food stores. The usual dosage for infertility is between 250 and 500 mg three times a day for two to three months (or as directed).</p><p>The fruits themselves may also be used (as they traditionally have been for millennia) as an infusion or decoction of the powdered fruits, 1.5 to 3 g daily.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Sheep and goats do not respond well to the herb. Occasionally the plant can be infected with a fungus while in storage. This can be avoided if you harvest the plant yourself or if you buy a commercial, standardized preparation. The plant itself is not known to cause adverse reactions in people, and there are no known contraindications for use.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None known.</p></div></div></body></html>
