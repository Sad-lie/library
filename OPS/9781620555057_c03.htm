Some of these environmental pollutants also have the capacity to bind free testosterone and to interfere with its creation or its proper levels in our bodies. This is affecting younger males, often through estrogenic impacts in the womb prior to their birth, as well as older men. Some of the impacts are extremely sobering. As a result of these external (or exogenous) estrogens, Peter Montague of <i>Rachel’s Environment and Health Weekly</i> (now <i>Rachel’s Democracy and Health News</i>) observed:</p><p class="blocktb">Each year more men in the industrialized world are getting cancer of the testicles [and prostate], birth defects affecting the penis, lowered sperm count, lowered sperm quality, and undescended testicles.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr3"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt3">1</a></sup></p><p>The degree of this shift in male androgen levels is a relatively new occurrence. It began in a very mild way in Europe in 1516 with the passage of the German Beer Purity Act (see the section on hops in chapter 7), spread very slowly for three hundred years, and then began escalating with the discovery and production of synthetic chemicals in industry. Researchers have found that the shifts in male androgen levels and ratios we are now seeing come from hundreds of synthetically produced estrogenic chemicals (estrogen mimics) as well as androgen antagonists or antiandrogens that directly deactivate androgens in our bodies. The past sixty years have seen an evolutionarily unprecedented proliferation of these kinds of synthetic chemicals. One-third of American men, about thirty million of us, are estimated to be experiencing some form of erectile dysfunction or impotence. But, the males of every species, not just humans, are paying the price of these estrogenic pollutants.</p><div id="c03s01.01"><p class="csht">T<small>HE</small> E<small>FFECTS OF</small> E<small>STROGEN</small> M<small>IMICS AND</small> A<small>NDROGEN</small> A<small>NTAGONISTS ON</small> M<small>ALE</small> H<small>EALTH</small></p><p class="ctx1">Over the past fifty years, scientists have recorded a frightening shift in men’s reproductive health. Sperm counts are showing a significant decline worldwide, testicular cancer has grown at approximately 2 to 4 percent per year in men under fifty years of age, a general increase in cryptorchidism (undescended testes) has occurred in young men, and general increases in hypospadia (penile deformities) have been seen.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr4"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt4">2</a></sup> The increases in testicular cancer, for instance, parallel almost exactly the historical rise in production of synthetic chemicals—industrial, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical. From 1880 to 1920, there was virtually no change in testicular cancer rates. After 1920, they began to rise steadily in direct proportion to the amount of synthetic chemicals that were being produced worldwide.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr5"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt5">3</a></sup></p><p class="cgs"><b>Estrogenic Pollution</b></p><p class="ctx1">These kinds of reproductive problems are being seen in the males of scores of species throughout the world: panthers, birds, fish, alligators, frogs, bats, turtles, and many more. Louis Guillette, a reproductive endocrinologist and professor of zoology at the University of Florida, is an expert on the study of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment. He has spent years studying the effects of environmental endocrine disruptors (chemicals that interfere with the activity of sexual hormones). His research on male alligators, he notes, has consistently shown that androgen levels, androgen ratios, and free testosterone levels are all significantly altered by environmental pollutants and have been for some time. “In males,” Guillette writes, “this abnormality in testosterone persists, so there is a dramatic change in circulating levels of testosterone. DHT is altered as well, and some males have elevated levels of estrogens. So there are feminized males.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr6"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt6">4</a></sup> He comments that the levels of chemicals needed to produce such changes are incredibly tiny. “We did not [test] one part per trillion for the contaminant, as we assumed that was too low. Well, we were wrong. It ends up that everything from a hundred parts per trillion to ten parts per million are ecologically relevant . . . at these levels there is sex reversal . . . [And our research] shows that the highest dose does not always give the greatest response. That has been a very disturbing issue for many people trying to do risk assessment in toxicology.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr7"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt7">5</a></sup></p><p>Pharmaceutical-quality steroids are in fact extremely pervasive in world ecosystems. They are entering soil, air, and water in the millions of tons from farming and the heavy use of estrogenic pharmaceuticals by women worldwide. Birth control pills and menopausal hormone replacement therapies are especially pervasive sources of estrogenic pollution. The synthetic estrogen Premarin, for example, is the most widely prescribed pharmaceutical in the United States. Pharmaceuticals such as these are excreted out of the human body and enter the environment, where they continue to be active as steroidal chemicals. Researchers commonly find synthetic estradiol, the most potent estrogen, and another estrogen, estrone, in wastewater coming from sewage plants. They have regularly found concentrations of estradiol at 14 parts per trillion (ppt) and estrone at 400 ppt. All of the male fish downstream from such concentrations of estrogen pollution have been found to exhibit sexual reproductive problems, many of them becoming female. Researchers testing the potency of these estrogens found that sex changes begin at the incredibly tiny levels of 0.1 ppt of estradiol and 10 ppt of estrone.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr8"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt8">6</a></sup></p><p class="cgs"><b>DDT and Other Chemicals</b></p><p class="ctx1">Other chemicals such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and their metabolites (the chemicals they are metabolized into) are strongly active as estrogen mimics and are prevalent throughout the world’s soils, water, and air. Millions of tons of these estrogen mimics are used as pesticides on farms throughout the world. Especially impactful are huge agribusiness operations, which use these kinds of chemicals in tremendous quantities to increase animal growth.</p><p>Although people in the United States think that DDT is ancient history, it is not. Although it is not used in the United States, it is still common in other parts of the world. In fact, in 1995 more DDT was used than at any previous time in history.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr9"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt9">7</a></sup> The United States is not an ecologically isolated country, and chemicals such as DDT circulate in the atmosphere and oceans, so there are still measurable amounts of DDT throughout the soil and water of the United States. DDT is, in fact, a globally pervasive chemical. Recent studies have regularly found DDT in the blood of North American wildlife at average concentrations of 1 nanogram per milliliter. This is about 1,000 times higher than the normal blood levels of free estradiol (which DDT mimics) that should be found in wildlife.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr10"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt10">8</a></sup> And p,p’-DDE, a breakdown byproduct of DDT, has been found to be a powerful androgen antagonist, strongly interfering with male androgen balances and levels in all male species that encounter it.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr11"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt11">9</a></sup> The common pesticide vinclozolin, used on agricultural products such as cucumbers, grapes, lettuce, onions, bell peppers, raspberries, strawberries, and tomatoes, is also a powerful androgen antagonist. Sold under the trade names Ronilan, Ornalin, Curalan, and Voralan and mixed as a part of products such as Hitrun, Kinker, Ronilan M, Ronilan T Combi, Silbos, and Fungo50, it is widely available for agricultural and gardening use. One of its breakdown byproducts (a metabolite) has been found to be 100 times more powerful than vinclozolin as an androgen antagonist.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr12"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt12">10</a></sup> Some of the environmental pollutants, such as the fungicide propiconazole, are so strong that numerous researchers have begun exploring the use of their active chemicals (imidazole derivatives) as male contraceptives.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr13"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt13">11</a></sup> Pyrimidine carbinol fungicides are so potent that they can actually inhibit all hormone production. They completely block the synthesis of sterols, including cholesterol, from which all steroid hormones are made.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr14"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt14">12</a></sup></p><p>Phthalates, used widely in medicine to make plastics flexible, have also been found to significantly affect androgen-dependent tissues.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr15"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt15">13</a></sup> Health Care Without Harm, an organization trying to help minimize the negative health impacts from hospitals and medical technology, notes that although some phthalates act as estrogen mimics, others are powerful androgen antagonists. One phthalate, DEHP (Di-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate), and its metabolite, MEHP (mono-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate), show significant testicular toxicity, especially to the testes’ Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells nurse immature sperm to maturity, and phtalate-related chemical toxicity results in decreased sperm production. Simply using medical devices (such as plasma bags or tubing) that contain DEHP can result in significant drops in sperm health because the phthalates readily leach out of the plastic and into the human body.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr16"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt16">14</a></sup> Dioxins and plastics that contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) produce similar kinds of impacts on male health.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Concerns of Environmental Groups</b></p><p class="ctx1">The environmental group Greenpeace has raised concern about just a few of the synthetic chemicals that are known to be hormone disruptors, including the following:</p><ul><li>Eleven common pesticides and their metabolites</li><li>PCBs (still environmentally present although no longer produced)</li><li>Dioxins and furans (by-products of chlorine production and the
chlorinated plastic PVC)</li><li>Bisphenol A (an ingredient used in dental fillings and to coat the
inside of tin cans and reusable milk bottles)</li><li>Phthalates (used to make plastic flexible in such things as checkbook
covers, medical tubing, baby teething rings)</li><li>Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a food additive<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr17"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt17">15</a></sup></li></ul><p>Increasingly, these substances are being found to have direct impacts on male reproductive health. As the authors of <i>Our Stolen Future</i> report, “Several studies report that infertile men have higher levels of PCBs and other synthetic chemicals in their blood or semen, and one analysis found a correlation between the swimming ability of a man’s sperm and the concentration of [PCBs] found in his semen.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr18"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt18">16</a></sup></p><p>It is not only environmental groups that are concerned. Scientific organizations and environmental agencies in countries throughout the world have come to the inescapable conclusion that male health in every species on Earth is being negatively affected by these synthetic chemicals.</p><p>As only one example, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency released a report in 1995 titled “Male Reproductive Health and Environmental Chemicals with Estrogenic Effects.” The 175-page report identified numerous consumer products that contain known hormone-disrupting chemicals such as “pesticides, detergents, cosmetics, paints, and packaging materials including plastic containers and food wraps.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr19"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt19">17</a></sup> Ten classes of chemicals containing hundreds of different types of products were listed as agents of concern.</p><p>Peter Montague reflects that the report makes clear that “in contrast [to natural hormones], many industrial chemicals that enter the body are not readily broken down so they circulate in the blood for long periods—in some cases many years—mimicking natural hormones.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr20"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt20">18</a></sup> What is worse, these hormonally active substances can combine with each other in ways that are not understood, are not predictable, and have never been studied.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Effects of Pollutants</b></p><p class="ctx1">The impacts of these kinds of chemicals on our lives and our movements through the stages of our lives as men cannot be overstated. It is tremendously important to recognize that many of the contemporary difficulties that men are experiencing in middle age or even as young adults are the result of the pervasive intake of nanogram-sized quantities of these chemicals. Prostate problems, erectile dysfunction, sterility, sperm motility problems, loss of energy, libido, and even atherosclerosis (fat-clogged arteries), heart disease, and many more common physical problems can be tied to the disruption of the androgen/estrogen balance and the dropping levels of free testosterone in our bodies. In 1920, men in the United States had the same life expectancy as women. As increasing numbers of estrogenic-like substances entered the environment and our bodies, our life expectancy has dropped until we now lag eight years behind women.</p><p>The pervasive problem of these chemicals is being compounded by the significant shift in the foods we eat. Over the million years of our evolutionary history, human beings lived as a part of their forest and savanna homes. Normally, they ate several hundred to several thousand kinds of plants each year as a regular part of their diet. Our human bodies have been used to that kind of food intake for a million years; they expect it and need it. The majority of these plants are filled with hundreds to thousands of potent natural chemicals that we need to remain healthy. On average, people in the industrialized nations now eat from five to twelve vegetables per year. Most of the vegetables have been modified for taste, which has reduced or eliminated many of their most potent chemical components.</p><p>The combination of these converging historical events is ensuring that men do not enter middle age in vital health as we historically have done. This is why it becomes important for many of us to actively work in some fashion to restore our natural levels and ratios of androgens.</p></div></div></body></html>
