One finding is important for understanding the nature of our sexuality as men. That is that male infants, in the womb, have regular erections—so do male infants after birth. Our sexuality is as much a part of us as breathing, our need for food, our need for love. Through it, we learn one of the deepest patterns embedded within nearly all life forms on Earth. Through it, we can also experience the joy of joining with another human being in one of the most intimate and pleasurable acts ever known. But, this deeply ingrained sexuality within men expands itself outward and becomes much more than simply a form of human procreation, enjoyable sharing, or deep intimacy. Our sexual vitality flows through everything we do, infuses our work, helps us create new forms of work, play, and intimacy. It is an essential element in our response to the touch of the world upon us, and it is intimately connected to our capacity for imagination. Testosterone, research has shown, is an important neural chemical, not just a sexual hormone. It has many impacts in the central nervous system and on the functioning of the brain. Men enjoy watching women, in part, because it immediately stimulates their production of testosterone, which stimulates their imagination, which stimulates more testosterone, which stimulates . . . well, it just keeps going on.</p><p>This increase in male vitality then infuses everything a man does throughout the day. Physical agility increases, energy levels are enhanced, and the brain, infused with tremendous amounts of testosterone, becomes more mentally alert and imaginative. A study at the Max Planck Institute in Germany in 1974 revealed that three-fourths of the men who were shown a mildly erotic film experienced significant increases in their blood levels of testosterone. These high testosterone levels were found in another study, not surprisingly, to increase resistance and immunity to many diseases. There is a reason why men are biologically driven to look at those they consider sexually attractive—it stimulates testosterone production in the body and brain.</p><p>When androgen levels fall or the androgen/estrogen ratio is skewed too far, a great many things are affected. Many of the sexual problems that men struggle with can be directly traced to the high levels of estrogenic chemicals in the environment. Besides low free testosterone levels and imbalances in the androgen/estrogen ratio, the most common problems are infertility, erectile dysfunction or impotence, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</p><p>Many of the plants already discussed in this book are good for these conditions, a few others are specific. The more healthy the testes, adrenals, prostate gland, and circulatory system are, the better the sexual health of a man, and the more energetic the production of androgens.</p><div id="c08s01.01"><p class="csht">I<small>NFERTILITY</small></p><p class="ctx1">Generally, <i>infertility</i> in men refers to either low sperm counts (oligospermia) or comatose sperm—sperm whose motility or movement is impaired. There are a number of plants, supplements, and foods that have been found to be helpful for these conditions, many of them in clinical studies or trials.</p><p>There are four plants and one combination of medicinal plants that seem to be the strongest for promoting sperm production and sperm motility. These are Chinese dogwood, tribulus, speman, and ginseng.</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="centtb"><b>Natural Care for Infertility</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Suggested dosage for two to six months:</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Chinese dogwood:</b> Tea daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>Tribulus:</b> 250 mg three times per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Speman:</b> Two tablets three times per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Panax and tienchi ginseng tincture:</b> Up to ⅓ tsp. per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>L-carnitine:</b> 500 to 1000 mg per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>L-arginine:</b> 500 to 3000 mg per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Vitamin C:</b> 500 to 1000 mg per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Zinc:</b> 20 to 40 mg per day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Vitamin B:</b> Supplement daily</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Chinese Dogwood <i>(Cornus officinalis)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Cornaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Fruit</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Chinese dogwood, also called Japanese cornel, is an ornamental tree, much like our American dogwoods. It grows naturally throughout eastern China and Japan and has been planted as an ornamental throughout much of the rest of the world. The fruit is harvested when ripe. It should have an orange color and sour taste, a bit like a cross between a cranberry and a chewy orange candy.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Chinese dogwood fruit, called <i>Fructus corni</i> or Shan zhu yu in Chinese medicine, has been used for several thousand years as a tonic/stimulant for the kidneys/urinary system and as a tonic for the male reproductive system. The bark is a febrifuge (lowers fevers) and is often used for malaria. The bark of many other species of dogwood is used for malarial conditions as well; however, with this species, the fruits are actually favored.</p><p>The fruit is usually dried and used as a tea for: impotence, lack of sexual desire, incontinence, frequent urination, tinnitus, vertigo, hair loss, arthritis, and diabetes. Interestingly, this collection of physical problems are all associated with lowered or altered testosterone levels and poor blood circulation, which itself is linked to altered androgen levels.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Chinese Dogwood:</b> Many botanists consider Chinese dogwood to be much the same as our American dogwood <i>(Cornus florida),</i> and some practitioners consider the two medicinally interchangeable. However, the only specific studies on sperm motility have occurred with the Asian species.</p><p>The current interest in the plant has been stimulated by its long standing use for several thousand years as a male fertility agent, usually as a tea, in both Japan and China. While limited, those Western-style studies that have been conducted on dogwood are highly promising. Regular consumption of an infusion (a strong tea) of dogwood fruit has consistently resulted in better sperm motility, generally increasing movement by as much as 68 percent. One particular chemical constituent of the fruit (as yet identified only as C4) has been isolated and found to be the most potent, enhancing motility 120 percent. Other studies have found that cornus increases blood flow to the kidneys and spleen and that the fruit enhances the antioxidant defenses of the heart’s vascular endothelial tissue.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Prepare an infusion by letting 1 oz of the dried fruit steep in a pint of hot water for twenty minutes. Begin with 1 cup per day and slowly increase to 3 per day by the end of one week. Add honey if desired; the herb is somewhat sour.</p><p>Cornus can be somewhat hard to find. The Internet and Chinese herb suppliers are the best sources. See the Resource Section of the book for suppliers.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Contraindications and Side Effects:</b> Do not use if there is blood in the urine or painful urination.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Tribulus <i>(Tribulus terrestris)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>About Tribulus:</b> Tribulus was extensively discussed in chapter 4. Please refer to that chapter for more data on the plant. I include here only the material directly bearing on infertility.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Specifics for Infertility:</b> Each testicle contains some five hundred convoluted somniferous tubules which, if laid end to end, would stretch 750 feet. Inside these tubules are the Sertoli cells that make both androgen binding protein and sperm. Androgen binding protein calls both testosterone and DHT to wherever it is located in order to concentrate androgens in a specific place. It is concentrated in the Sertoli cells and the epididymis, the long structure at the back of each testicle. It takes sixty-four days for the Sertoli cells to make sperm, which they do in sixteen-day intervals. Immature sperm cells, which are called spermatogonia, mature in sequence into spermatocytes, spermatids, and then into spermatozoa (aka sperm).</p><p>Tribulus is specific to both the Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testes. It causes the hypothalamus to release more luteinizing hormone (which stimulates the Leydig cells to produce more testosterone), increases the density of the Leydig cells (thus creating more cells to make testosterone), increases the levels of androgen binding protein, which increases the amount of testosterone and DHT in the Sertoli cells and epididymis (which increases the efficiency of the maturation of sperm), increases the numbers of spermatogonia, and increases the spermatogonia’s transformation into spermatocytes and spermatids. This results in enhanced fertility in the men who take the herb.</p><p>As discussed previously in chapter 4, clinical study has found that from 50 to 80 percent of men using standardized preparations of tribulus experience significantly improved sperm production and motility. One study noted that taking 500 mg three times a day for sixty days significantly increased sperm production for men diagnosed with idiopathic oligozoospermia (men who show <i>no</i> sperm in the semen from no discernable cause). Libido, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm all increased significantly for 80 percent of the men. Another, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed significant increases in sperm motility with corresponding decreases in immotile sperm. Numerous other studies have shown similar outcomes. Tribulus has been found to increase levels of leutenizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), DHEA, and interestingly, estradiol in women and testosterone in men but not vice versa. This indicates it is a general reproductive system adaptogen and tonic, rather than specific to gender.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Tribulus is available under a number of brand names, including Tribestan, Trilovin, Libilov, and so on, and can be easily found on the Internet and in many health food stores. The usual dosage for infertility is between 250 and 500 mg a day for two to three months (or as directed).</p><p>The fruits themselves may also be used (as they traditionally have been for millennia) as an infusion or decoction of the powdered fruits: 1.5 to 3 g daily.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> The plant itself is not known to cause adverse reactions in people, and there are no known contraindications for use. Sheep and goats, however, do not respond well to the herb. Occasionally the plant can be infected with a fungus while in storage. This can be avoided if you harvest the plant yourself or if you buy a commercial, standardized preparation.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Speman</b></p><p class="ctx1">Speman is an herbal combination long used in traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) practice. It contains: <i>Orchis mascula</i> (65 mg), <i>Lactuca sca</i><i>riola</i> (16 mg), <i>Hygrophila spinosa</i> (32 mg), <i>Mucuna pruriens</i> (16 mg), <i>Parmelia parlata</i> (16 mg), <i>Argyeia speciosa</i> (32 mg), <i>Tribulus terres</i><i>tris</i> (32 mg), <i>Leptandenia reticulata</i> (16 mg), and suvarnavang (mosaic gold, 16 mg). A number of clinical trials have explored its use in a wide variety of conditions, including oligospermia (low sperm count), oligozoospermia (no sperm in ejaculate), asthenospermia (lack of ejaculate), necrozoospermia (dead sperm), prostatitis, and BPH. About half of the men who take speman show significant increases in sperm count and motility; many of their wives subsequently conceive.</p><p>Clinical studies have included as few as twenty-one men to as many as six hundred. In only one example, 307 men between the ages of twenty-two and forty-five were given 2 speman tablets three times per day for three months. After three months, half of the couples conceived. Speman has been found to be effective, as well, in treating people with prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia in a number of clinical trials.</p><p>Speman has also been used in vivo and been found to stimulate mouse sexual activity and to protect mouse testes, epididymis, and adrenals from cadmium poisoning. This is interesting in that speman shows a general protective and tonic effect on the male reproductive system. It corrects imbalances but also prevents future damage.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage and Availability:</b> Two tablets three times a day for three months, repeat if necessary. Widely available on the Internet from Ayurvedic suppliers.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Less than 1 percent of people who take speman complain of short-term dizziness, which is the only known side effect.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> The literature does not mention any at this point in time.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Asian Ginseng <i>(Panax ginseng)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>About Asian Ginseng:</b> This species has been found in numerous studies to increase sperm production. This is discussed in detail in chapter 4, beginning on page 34. Please refer to that chapter for more detailed information.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Asian ginseng can be taken as tablets, 1 to 9 g per day, or as a tincture. The tincture is prepared 1:5 in 70percent alcohol. Normal (American) dosage range is: 5 to 20 drops per day of kirin (dark red) ginseng tincture and 20 to 40 drops per day of white. Asians often consume it in much higher dosages. <b>Note:</b> For androgen replacement purposes, Asian ginseng should be used and <i>not</i> American ginseng. I generally prefer to combine Asian ginseng with Tienchi ginseng (see next listing). I use a combination of tienchi (tinctured 1:5, 70% alcohol) and Asian ginseng, half and half, taking <sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">1</sup>/3 tsp. per day in water.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Availability:</b> Asian ginseng in many forms is widely available at health food stores and on the Internet.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Ginseng can be quite stimulating and should be used in small doses at first and the dosage increased once you are used to it. It can sometimes cause hypertension, especially with large, sustained doses, and is contraindicated for those with extremely elevated blood pressure. It can be used with care in mild hypertension and with oversight in moderate hypertension. Sustained overuse can cause insomnia, muscle tension, headaches, and sometimes heart palpitations. It may cause difficulty in sleeping if taken before bedtime. Because it affects androgen and testosterone levels, it should not be used by adolescent men.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Avoid ginseng use with warfarin (Coumadin), phenelzine (Nardil), digoxin (Lanoxin), or haloperidol (Haldol). Avoid hypoglycemic drugs, anticoagulants, and adrenal stimulants. Caution should be exercised in its use with MAO inhibitors. Ginseng may block the painkilling actions of morphine.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Tienchi Ginseng <i>(Panax notoginseng)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>About Tienchi:</b> In a number of studies, tienchi ginseng has been found to increase sperm production. It is discussed in detail in chapter 4, page 39. Please refer to that chapter for more detailed information.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 1:5 tinctures—30 drops (aka 1.5 mL or ⅜ tsp.) three times daily. In severe depletion conditions, may be increased to twice that dose but side effects should be monitored. <b>Note:</b> For male health, as an antifatigue agent, and for testosterone enhancement, I prefer to combine tienchi ginseng with Asian ginseng. I generally use a combination of tienchi (tinctured 1:5, 70% alcohol) and Asian, half and half, taking <sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">1</sup>/3 tsp. per day.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Although not commonly known, tienchi, in a small percentage of users, can produce allergic reactions. Generally, these manifest as some sort of rash: urticaria, red papules, skin itching, flushed skin. Very rarely there can be mild anaphylaxis, abdominal pain or swelling, or diarrhea. These are uncommon—about nineteen instances reported out of millions of users.</p><p>High doses of the herb can cause nervousness, sleeplessness, anxiety, breast pain, headache, high blood pressure, insomnia, and restlessness. The plant is a corticosteroidogenic herb, that is, it stimulates the production of catabolic steroids such as adrenaline and cortisol by the adrenal glands.</p><p>The use of tienchi ginseng should be discontinued at least seven days prior to surgery because it can lower blood glucose levels and can act as a blood thinner. It should not be used during pregnancy because its constituents can cross from breast milk into nursing children. (These conditions correct upon discontinuance of the herb.) It should not be used by adolescent men due to potential androgenic conflicts.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Do not use with blood-thinning agents or warfarin (may decrease the effectiveness of those drugs). It may and probably will increase the effects of amphetamine-like stimulants, including caffeine. Do not use with haloperidol, an antipsychotic, it may exaggerate the drug’s effects. Tienchi may block the effects of morphine and its use with MAO inhibitors, such as phenelzine, may cause symptoms such as headaches, manic episodes, and tremulousness.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Infertility Supplements</b></p><p class="ctx1">There are five infertility supplements that have been found to help sperm production in men. They are arginine, carnitine, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and zinc. <b>Note:</b> L-arginine and L-carnitine, as opposed to arginine and carnitine, are natural forms of those substances rather than synthetic pharmaceuticals. When buying supplements make sure that you buy the L- form of both carnitine and arginine as they are more effective.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>L-arginine</b></p><p class="ctx1">L-arginine, an amino acid normally present in the body, has been found, in some cases, to significantly improve sperm motility and sperm count. Arginine is an essential amino acid that is needed for the replication of cells, making it an important nutrient in sperm production. It is a natural source of nitric oxide, which is crucial for erections (see the Erectile Dysfunction section, page 108). One study showed a doubling of sperm count in two weeks with the use of L-arginine. In another, 74 percent of 178 men with low sperm counts showed significant increases in sperm motility and production. The latter study used 4 g of L-arginine per day.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Take one or two 500 mg capsules up to three times daily. Arginine is present in large quantities in pine pollen, sunflower seeds, brazil nuts, almonds, peanuts, lentils, kidney beans, and soybeans. Liberal quantities in the diet can help increase arginine levels in the body.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> L-arginine should be avoided in cases of shingles or herpes because it can exacerbate the outbreak of these conditions. It will not usually initiate an outbreak, but existing viruses can use arginine to enhance their replication. L-arginine can also affect blood sugar levels and diabetics should only take it under the supervision of a health care provider.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>L-carnitine</b></p><p class="ctx1">The epididymis, the oblong structure connected to the back of the testicles, is the first part of the excretory ducts of the testicles and, like sperm, it contains extremely concentrated amounts of L-carnitine. Low L-carnitine levels directly cause low sperm motility and production. Increasing the levels of L-carnitine immediately increases sperm motility—the higher the levels, the higher the motility. In one study, taking 1000 mg of L-carnitine three times daily for three months was found to increase sperm count and mobility in thirty-seven of the forty-seven men who used it.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 500 to 1000 mg three times per day.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Vitamin B Complex</b></p><p class="ctx1">A number of B vitamins have been shown to play a role in both sexuality and sperm counts. B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">12</sub> 
deficiency, for example, leads to reduced sperm counts and reduced motility. 
Studies have shown significant increases in sperm count and motility when men 
were given from 1000 to 6000 mcg of B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">12</sub> daily.</p><p>Niacin, another B vitamin, can produce a flush to the skin very similar to the flush many people experience during sex. There is a dilation of capillaries and blood vessels and an increase of blood flow throughout the body. In vivo studies with stallions have shown that the B vitamin niacin increases their capacity to reach orgasm. Many people taking it also report increased enjoyment of sex. Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub> has been shown to increase stamina and endurance and has strong effects on maintaining healthy adrenal glands, the source of most of the body’s DHEA. Choline, another member of the B-vitamin family, has been shown to exert strong effects on sex. Choline is involved in the production of acetylcholine, which is the primary neurotransmitter that sends signals from the brain to muscle systems throughout the body. Some studies have indicated that choline supplementation increases sexual responsiveness, interest levels, and stamina. Taking a good B-complex formula regularly is important; you may wish to add 1000 to 6000 mcg of B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">12</sub> as well.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Vitamin C</b></p><p class="ctx1">Vitamin C has been found to directly promote sperm health and motility. Dietary vitamin C plays a significant role in protecting sperm from DNA damage. In one study, dietary vitamin C was reduced to 5 mg per day from 250 mg. The number of sperm with DNA damage increased to 99 percent, while the ascorbic acid levels in seminal fluid decreased by 50 percent. Vitamin C has also been found to increase sperm motility in smokers (who tend to have lower sperm motility). Daily intake of from 200 to 1000 mg of vitamin C can increase sperm motility and sperm production and reduce agglutination or the clumping together of sperm. (If more than 25 percent of sperm clump together, fertility is severely impaired.) In one study, by the end of twenty-one days, the amount of agglutinated sperm in men taking Vitamin C had dropped to 11 percent. By the end of sixty days, all of the women whose men were taking Vitamin C had conceived, but none in a placebo group had done so. Vitamin C also increases testosterone production and improves the P450 system in the liver, which eliminates excess estrogen.</p><p>I prefer taking Vitamin C as an effervescent, nonacidic powder in water; it’s kind of like Alka-Seltzer. It is much easier to take this way, and it is assimilated into the body much faster.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Take 500 to 1000 mg per day.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> Vitamin C can cause stomach upset, flatulence, and diarrhea when taken in quantity. It is often prescribed “t.b.t.” or “t.b.d.,” meaning “to bowel tolerance” or “to bowel dose.” As soon as your body gets enough vitamin C, it excretes the remainder. To take Vitamin C t.b.t., take it until symptoms appear and then back off slightly. This is your bowel tolerance dose.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Zinc</b></p><p class="ctx1">Every time a man ejaculates, he uses 5 mg of zinc. Zinc is highly concentrated in both sperm and seminal fluid, and frequent ejaculation can lead to zinc depletion, especially if the diet is poor. Deficiencies of zinc in men result in reduced libido, low testosterone levels, and low sperm counts. Zinc levels are usually found to be low in infertile men with low sperm counts. Increasing the levels of zinc in the body can have an immediate, powerful effect on sperm motility, production, and even testosterone levels in the blood. A number of studies have shown that zinc supplementation immediately and significantly affects sperm motility and production. Even in cases of long standing infertility (more than five years), zinc can have a powerfully positive effect within two months. One study resulted in pregnancy for 40 percent of the men’s wives within two months of regular zinc use.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Men over forty should take 20 to 40 mg per day.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Foods for Infertility</b></p><p class="ctx1">There are a number of foods that have been found to help increase male sperm counts: oriental cashew nuts, garlic, and oysters.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Oriental Cashew Nuts <i>(Semecarpus anacardium or Anacardium occidental)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Anacardiaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> The nut, although the fruit (which is delicious) and the juice of the fruit have both been used medicinally as well.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> The oriental cashew tree grows throughout India and parts of China. It produces a fleshy receptacle, often referred to as an apple, at the end of which the kidney-shaped nut grows. There is an outer shell, ashen in color, and an inner shell covering the nut. Between these two shells is a highly caustic, flammable oil. (The tree is related to poison ivy.) Extreme caution must be exercised to avoid oil contact with the skin during harvest and processing of the nut.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Nutritive, cardiac tonic, mild aphrodisiac.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Oriental Cashew Nut:</b> In India, the Oriental cashew is commonly known as the “marking” nut because the sap of the tree (and sometimes the juice of the nut) has been traditionally used to make an indelible ink. In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, the nut kernel is considered to be a nutritive, digestive tonic, cardiac tonic, and respiratory stimulant. In Unani practice, it is used for polyuria (excessive secretion of urine), for improving memory, and as an aphrodisiac. It is common in folk medicine around the world to find the cashew used as a mild aphrodisiac and sexual stimulant for men. Interestingly, some clinical studies are beginning to bear this out.</p><p>Two human trials were conducted with Oriental cashew using the cotyledon—the first sprouting leaves of the germinating nut. An infusion using 2.4 g of the dried cotyledon was prepared and taken by twenty and thirty-two men for fourteen and sixty-eight weeks, respectively. Improvements were seen in fertility, sperm motility, and sperm production.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Eat the nut as often as desired as a regular part of the diet.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Nut sensitivities. Otherwise no side effects or contraindications are known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Garlic <i>(Allium sativum)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">As discussed previously in chapter 6, Garlic has a long reputation as a sexually supportive food for men. Part of this is attributable to its reliable ability to reduce high blood pressure and improve blood flow. Garlic also stimulates the entire male hormonal system, thus increasing testosterone production and enhancing libido. There is some indication as well that it improves sperm production. One in vivo trial with mice showed a significant increase in sperm production merely from adding garlic juice to their food. For this and many other reasons, it makes sense to add garlic to the diet regularly and often.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Avoid if you are taking anticoagulants, paracetamol (acetaminophen), or chlorpropamide.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Oysters</b></p><p class="ctx1">Oysters have long been considered an aid to sex. The reason is that oysters concentrate zinc to high levels in their bodies. Zinc is, perhaps, the most essential trace mineral for the production of healthy sperm and one of the most important minerals to male health. One hundred grams, about 4 oz, of oysters contain 150 mg of zinc. Eat as often as desired.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Things to Avoid</b></p><p class="ctx1">Cottonseed oil should be strongly avoided by men with infertility problems. The normal cautions about estrogenic plants also apply.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Cottonseed Oil</b></p><p class="ctx1">Men who regularly use raw cottonseed oil have been found to possess low sperm counts and eventually experience, if they do not stop, a total failure of the testes to produce sperm. This is because cottonseed oil contains a powerful male anti-fertility compound called gossypol, which strongly inhibits sperm production. Make sure that whatever you are eating does not contain cottonseed oil (it is often found in solid cooking oils).</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Estrogenic Plants</b></p><p class="ctx1">As discussed in the last chapter, avoid licorice, black cohosh, and especially hops (as a supplement or in beer). All of these can interfere with spermatogenesis (the creation of sperm). Estrogenic substances such as hops interfere with the production of FSH or follicle stimulating hormone. In men, FSH supports the function of the testes Sertoli cells, which in turn supports many aspects of sperm cell maturation and production. Any substance that reduces its production causes low sperm counts.</p></div><div id="c08s01.02"><p class="csht">E<small>RECTILE</small> D<small>YSFUNCTION</small></p><p class="ctx1">Some thirty million American men—about one-third of the sexually active male population—have been estimated to suffer some form of erectile dysfunction. When Viagra was released, one million prescriptions were filled the first year—a billion dollars in sales for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Continued use, however, has also brought recognition of its side effects. Within five months, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that sixty-nine people who had been using Viagra had died; forty-six of the deaths were related to cardiovascular disease, exacerbated, many felt, by the drug. Although there may be a place for Viagra, there are a great many natural approaches to treating impotence, the majority which have few or no side effects. One of the advantages of natural alternatives is that, in the long run, they can correct the underlying causes of many forms of erection problems. Viagra cannot, it must be taken forever (a common problem with pharmaceuticals).</p><p>There are a number of causes of erectile dysfunction, but four of the most prevalent are:</p><ul><li>estrogens or estrogen mimics in the environment or diet</li><li>pharmaceuticals (can cause erection problems)</li><li>atherosclerosis of the penile artery (basically fat-clogged arteries)</li><li>diabetes-related high blood sugar levels, which cause a narrowing of the blood vessels</li></ul><p>It is thought by a number of researchers and clinicians that about half of erectile dysfunction problems come from atherosclerosis. Erection depends on a strong supply of blood to the penis, and with poor circulation to the extremities due to clogged arteries, there is often an insufficient supply of blood to produce an erection.</p><p>If you have erectile dysfunction, have a check up for high cholesterol levels and diabetes. Simple tests in any physician’s office can easily determine the presence of either of these conditions.

The leaves are harvested in the fall when they turn from their normal green to a rich, ripe gold.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Ginkgo is a vasodilator, relaxant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and a cardiac and cerebral circulatory stimulant. Scores of studies have been conducted on ginkgo for use in stimulating peripheral circulation and improving blood flow in the brain, legs, and penis. Many of these have been double-blind, placebo, crossover trials. All of them have shown ginkgo’s effectiveness.</p><p>Ginkgo has gained its modern reputation for helping the memory problems that sometimes occur with aging. Numerous clinical trials have shown that it stimulates blood flow in the brain, helping to alleviate forgetfulness and other memory disorders. However, ginkgo has a much larger range of action. It has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of heart disease and stroke, peripheral arterial insufficiency, eye disease, and impotence. Basically, ginkgo is effective any place in the body where there are problems from insufficient blood flow. This holds true as well for insufficient blood flow to the penis. Half to three-quarters of the men in various clinical trials have regained the ability to have regular erections after ginkgo use. In one trial, sixty men who had not reacted to injections of papaverine (a potent erectile stimulant) were given 60 mg of ginkgo daily for twelve to eighteen months. Blood flow improved after six to eight weeks of use, and after six months, 50 percent of the men had regained their ability to have erections. Another study explored the use of 80 mg of ginkgo three times a day by fifty men with dysfunction due to arterial insufficiency. The group was split into those who could achieve erection after injection of a drug (twenty men) and those that could not (thirty men). After six months of ginkgo use, the twenty men in the first group could achieve erections independently, as could nineteen of the men in the second group. Another trial found that after taking ginkgo for nine months, 78 percent of the men reported significant improvement in their ability to achieve erections. Ginkgo has even been found to help restore erections when the cause of dysfunction is from antidepressant pharmaceuticals. <i>For long term resolution of erection problems from arterial insufficiency, ginkgo is one of the primary herbs to use.</i> For short term, immediate gratification, potency wood and tribulus are more effective.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> The active constituents in ginkgo that help are considered to be present in insufficient quantities in the whole plant, so standardized extracts or capsules that concentrate them are generally suggested for use. Fifty pounds of ginkgo are used to make one pound of standardized extract. Usually the extracts contain at least 24 percent ginkgo flavonglycosodes—what researchers consider to be the active constituent of the plant.</p><p>The suggested dosage is 60 to 240 mg per day. Improvement can usually be felt in two months, but restoration of regular erection ability can often take six months of regular use. Ginkgo’s effectiveness has been found to increase when used with L-arginine and magnesium.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> There is sometimes sensitivity to ginkgo preparations. Caution should be used if you are taking antithrombotic medications. Uncommonly, side effects can include mild gastrointestinal upset or headache and, very rarely, allergic skin reactions. In very large doses, ginkgo can cause diarrhea, irritability, and restlessness.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> Ginkgo should not be used with anticoagulants such as aspirin and warfarin. Discontinue use seven days prior to surgery. Do not use with thiacide diuretics or trazodone.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Muira Puama <i>(Ptychopetalum olacoides; P. uncinatum and P. guyanna are considered interchangeable)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Olacaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Parts Used:</b> All parts of the tree are used, most commonly the bark.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Muira puama, native to the Brazilian Amazon, is a bush or small tree that grows to 15 feet in height. Usually the bark is used medicinally; it can be harvested whenever needed.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Aphrodisiac, antirheumatic, antistressor, antidysenteric, central nervous system stimulant, nervine, neurasthenic (helps nervous debility and lack of strength). Reduces nerve pain, nerve paralysis, and hysterical stressed states.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Muira Puama:</b> Muira puama (aka potency wood) is native to Brazil and has a long history of use as an aphrodisiac and nerve stimulant in South American medicine. It was “discovered” by the Western world in the mid-nineteenth century and rose to prominence in the early twentieth. It has been a regular part of medical practice in England, France, and Germany since that time.</p><p>Muira puama seems to possess a consistently strong activity as an antirheumatic and neuromuscular tonic, helping alleviate muscle and joint pain. However, the primary benefits in erectile dysfunction are that it strongly relaxes and calms the body (which reduces stress effects on sexual arousal while promoting blood flow to the penis). This action in turn stimulates sexual arousal, erection, and central nervous system activity. These effects have been borne out in clinical use and trial.</p><p>In one clinical trial, 262 men with low libido and the inability to maintain or have an erection were given 1 to 1.5 g of muira puama extract. After two weeks, 62 percent of the men experienced a return of libido, and 51 percent (132) had noted significant help with erectile function. Another trial found positive benefits for men with sexual asthenia (fatigue, loss of strength, or lack of sexual vitality, all of which are typical signs of low testosterone levels or androgen/estrogen imbalance). One hundred men complaining of impotence or lack of libido, or both, took part in the trial, ninety-four completed it. Sixty-six percent of the couples reported significantly increased frequency of intercourse, stability of erection was restored for 55 percent of the men, 66 percent reported reduced fatigue, and 70 percent reported an intensification of libido. Sleep improvement and increased morning erections were reported by many of the men.</p><p>The reasons for muira puama’s actions are unknown, however the plant does contain a number of plant steroids such as beta-sitosterol, which has a normalizing and enhancing activity on male hormone activity. The herb has shown the strongest effects when the cause of erectile dysfunction is not psychosomatic and is caused more by fatigue and stress.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Muira puama has been used for hundreds of years in the Amazon River region as a tea to help men with sexual dysfunction. However, a number of clinicians feel that the most effective form of the herb is as a tincture, 1 to 3 ml (¼–¾ tsp.) two times daily. The suggested daily dosage of the powder is 1 to 2.5 g per day (about ½ to 1¼ tsp.) or 1000 to 2500 mg of the encapsulated herb.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> None noted.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None currently known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Tribulus (Puncture Vine)</b></p><p class="ctx1">Tribulus is discussed in detail at the end of chapter 4. It has been found effective in a number of studies for helping stimulate erection. In one study, of seven impotent men using one standardized tribulus 250-mg tablet, three times a day for two weeks, four of the men experienced improved erection, including prolonged duration of erection after treatment had ceased. Another study with fifty-three men using three 250-mg tablets twice a day for three months showed significant improvements in a majority of the men in sex drive, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. Three studies on diabetic men with erectile dysfunction found increased erection and sexual intercourse in 60 percent. In another study, treatment with tribulus for as little as four weeks showed improvement in erection, duration of coitus, and postcoital satisfaction in fifty-six men.</p><p>Part of the reason for tribulus’s effectiveness is that it is a potent hypotensive, which means that it lowers blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. It also facilitates the actions of nitric oxide and acetylcholine in the penis, and it stimulates the production of DHEA in the body. More on tribulus can also be found in the previous section on infertility.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Take between 250 and 500 mg of the standardized herb as tablets or capsules three times a day for two to three months (or as directed).</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Yohimbe <i>(Pausinystalia yohimbe)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>Note:</b> I am not fond of this herb because I think there are too many potential side effects if used without sufficient knowledge. I am including it because so many people do use it and I think that the side effects from the plant and its wide range of herb/drug interactions should be understood.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Family:</b> Rubiaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Bark of the tree</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Collection and Habitat:</b> Yohimbe is an African tree growing to 100 feet in height that is common in west Africa. The bark from the branches or sections of the trunk is gathered when needed and dried for use.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Actions:</b> Alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, central nervous system stimulant, vasodilator, and erectile stimulant.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Yohimbe:</b> Yohimbe is the bark of an African tree that has, for centuries, been used in traditional African medicine for fevers, leprosy, coughs, and heart disease and as a local anesthetic. Because it so powerfully can dilate peripheral blood vessels, it has come to be used for erectile dysfunction. Most of the clinical trials, however, have been conducted using an isolated constituent of yohimbe called yohimbine (hydrochloride) which is available only by prescription under the brand names Yocon and Yohimex. Many of the over-the-counter preparations of yohimbe herb have been found to contain very little, if any, yohimbine (which it normally should have at about 7,000 parts per million). If you do decide to use this herb buy only from extremely reputable herbal companies and use with caution (see Side Effects and Contraindications).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Tincture: 5 to 10 drops three times per day. Powdered yohimbe bark: one or two capsules per day. The standardized dosage of the isolated fraction, yohimbine hydrochloride, is 15 to 20 mg per day, although a number of trials have shown that 40 to 45 mg per day may be a more effective range.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications: NOTE:</b> This herb is best used under the supervision of a qualified health care practitioner.</p><p>Most of the side effects listed here are from the use of the purified extract, yohimbine. Some of these side effects are from extremely high doses (more than 200 mg) given either orally or intravenously. Side effects seem to be an inevitable occurrence when plant constituents are removed from their natural setting. Most plants contain numerous other components <i>whose only known actions</i> are to counter the side effects of their more powerful neighbors. Very few studies have been done on yohimbe toxicity as opposed to the toxicity of purified yohimbine. However, you should be aware of these possible problems before you consider using this herb or its isolated fraction.</p><p>Side effects include anxiety, elevated blood pressure, exanthema (skin eruptions), excitatory states, nausea, sleeplessness, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), tremors, and vomiting. Moderate to extreme overdosage can cause salivation, extreme pupil dilation, lowered blood pressure, cardiac disorders, hallucination, and death.</p><p>Yohimbe and yohimbine extract should not be used by people who have anxiety, manic-depressive states, depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder, nervous disorders, low or high blood pressure, heart disease, pregnancy, or peptic ulcer or by people who are taking numerous medications (see Herb/Food/Drug Interactions below). The German Commission E Monographs note, without explanation, that the herb is contraindicated in liver and kidney disease. This commonly has been repeated in various texts such as the Physicians’ Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines. I have been unable to find a rationale for this in the literature.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug/Food Interactions:</b> There are many. Amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, epinephrine, chlorpromazine, promazine, chloprotixene, phenoxybenzamine, and phentolamine all can increase the toxicity of yohimbine and presumably yohimbe. Clonidine and reserpine can decrease anxiety caused by yohimbine and presumably yohimbe. Metoprolol, penbutolol, and propranolol protect against toxicity of yohimbine in animal studies. Tricyclic antidepressants, including imipramine, clomipramine, and amitriptyline, can produce hypertension when taken with yohimbine and possibly yohimbe.</p><p>Yohimbe can reduce the drug absorption and bioavailability of brimonidine, but it enhances the actions of bupropion and fluvoxamine. Do not take yohimbe or yohimbine with liver, cheese, red wine, or decongestants.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Toxicity:</b> A dose of 12 mg of yohimbe can induce a hypertensive crisis if taken with tricyclic antidepressants. A dose of 10 mg can induce mania in manic-depressive states. A dose of 15 mg has been associated with bronchospasm.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Supplements for Erectile Dysfunction</b></p><p class="ctx1">There are five supplements that have been found to help erectile dysfunction: L-arginine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-choline, and zinc.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>L-arginine</b></p><p class="ctx1">L-arginine is the physiological precursor for the formation of nitric oxide, which the body needs for erections to occur. The body converts arginine to nitric oxide during sexual arousal, and uses it to generate an erection. The nitric oxide dilates and relaxes the blood vessels in the penis, allowing them to engorge with blood and the penis to become erect. The more sexually stimulated a man becomes, the faster the body’s arginine is converted to nitric oxide. If the body is low in arginine, erections can be feeble or nonexistent. Increasing the supplementation of arginine alone has been shown to result in better and longer-lasting erections. Arginine is often used among animal breeders to enhance erections in bulls, roosters, and horses. More and more, research has shown that men can use the supplement with equally good results.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Take one or two 500 mg L-arginine capsules up to three times daily. Some researchers have suggested using 6 to 18 g forty-five minutes before sex. Others feel that lower doses of between 1.5 and 3 g are sufficient. Taking the supplement just before sex (within 45 minutes) allows the body sufficient amounts of L-arginine to generate an erection in response to stimulation. Daily supplementation will bring arginine levels up over time. Foods that contain arginine should be added to the diet. (See the section on Infertility.)</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> L-arginine should be avoided in cases of shingles or herpes because it can exacerbate the outbreak. L-arginine will not usually initiate an outbreak, but existing viruses can use it to enhance their replication. L-arginine can also affect blood sugar levels, so diabetics should only take it under the supervision of a health care provider.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine</b></p><p class="ctx1">These two amino acids are precursors to L-dopa, which stimulates both erections and sexual desire in people who take it regularly. Most are people with Parkinson’s disease whose bodies have quit making L-dopa in sufficient quantities. The primary side effect of the supplements for men with Parkinson’s disease seems to be heightened sexuality and a penchant for grabbing nurses.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 100 to 500 mg of each supplement daily.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> High doses of these supplements can increase blood pressure, especially if taken along with MAO inhibitors. Use with caution or under the care of a health care provider in cases of hypertension.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>L-choline</b></p><p class="ctx1">A number of studies have shown that acetylcholine plays an essential role in the transmission of nerve impulses from the brain to the penis during sexual arousal. The tissue in the penis that engorges with blood is high in acetylcholine, and the chemical plays an essential role, along with nitric oxide, during erections. L-choline is now considered to be an essential nutrient, needed by the body to generate sufficient acetylcholine for neurotransmission in the brain and, importantly, crucial for sexual arousal. Studies have found that the supplemental use of L-choline increases the body’s ability to generate erections.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 1000 to 3000 mg (1–3 g) daily.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> High doses of L-choline may cause stiff or tight muscles in the neck or shoulders, tension headache, or mild diarrhea. Some clinicians suggest taking L-choline with Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub> (pantothenic acid), which stimulates the health and activity of the adrenal glands and the adrenal output of male hormones. A few studies have found that the combination of choline and vitamin B leads to longer and more pleasurable erections. Some companies offer combinations of vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub>, choline, and arginine.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Zinc</b></p><p class="ctx1">Because zinc is so intimately connected to sexual health in men, it is essential to consider adding it regularly to the diet. A significant number of men with erectile problems have been found to be deficient in zinc. It is essential in the maintenance of testosterone levels in the body and the health and vitality of sperm. For more information on zinc, see chapter 5 (page 62).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 20 to 40 mg daily.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Foods for Erectile Dysfunction</b></p><p class="ctx1">There are four good ones: ginger, garlic, fava beans, and ox-eye beans.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Ginger</b></p><p class="ctx1">Ginger has a long tradition of use as an aphrodisiac; in traditional Chinese medicine it is considered a sexual tonic. Contemporary research has shown that it does have a strong effect on helping prevent or reverse atherosclerosis, and it stimulates peripheral circulation as well. Because atherosclerosis of the penile artery is the cause of half the erectile dysfunction of men over fifty, any food that can reduce or reverse it has a place in the diet. Suggested serving: daily in the diet, use fresh grated in food or drink; 1 to 2 cups of ginger tea per day.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Garlic</b></p><p class="ctx1">Because garlic is so powerful for reducing atherosclerosis and thus helping improve blood flow to the penis, it should be liberally included in the diet (see chapter 6, page 82).</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Fava and Ox-Eye Beans</b></p><p class="ctx1">There are now a significant number of clinical trials that show that adding foods high in soluble fiber, especially beans, to the diet regulates levels of blood sugar. Beans in general are important, but when impotence or erectile dysfunction are also problems fava beans are strongly indicated.</p><p>Fava and ox-eye beans (sometimes called velvet beans) contain significant amounts of L-dopa, an important prosexual chemical and dopamine precursor. L-dopa has the well-known side effect of increasing sexual interest and activity in anyone who takes it. It is also specific for helping create erections. Too much can cause a spontaneous persistent erection (priapism) that can sometimes be painful. Although neither bean contains enough to cause priapism by itself, healthy quantities of these beans can help stimulate erections while helping regulate blood sugar. Both have a reputation as aphrodisiacs, especially the ox-eye bean, which is a traditional aphrodisiac in Panamanian folk medicine. The sprouts of both fava and ox-eye beans contain even higher levels of L-dopa than the beans and are a good addition to salads. You can find these beans at many health food stores, and they can be easily ordered over the Internet.</p><p>Suggested serving: 8 to 16 oz of these beans three or more times per week.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Things to Avoid</b></p><p class="ctx1">Estrogenic plants, as already discussed, should be avoided, especially hops and hopped beers.

If the prostate swells, it can cut off the flow of urine, sort of like kinking a garden hose. The more it swells, the slower and more problematic the urine stream. So . . . it takes awhile to get the urine going, the urine stream is weak, the urine dribbles on for a bit afterward, it takes more push to empty the bladder, and the bladder may only partially empty, making more trips to the bathroom necessary—usually in the middle of the night (nocturia). And to top it off, the stream isn’t strong enough to fully open the tiny flaps at the end of the penis, and the urine stream shoots out in two directions. No matter how you aim, while one stream will go in the toilet, the other hits the wall, or the floor, or the seat. Your wife and friends begin to insist you sit down to pee. And it all used to be so easy.</p><p>Inflammation and enlargement of the prostate have both been around a long time. For hundreds of years, they were lumped together in a condition called strangury—a lovely, beautifully descriptive term—the <i>strangling</i> of the urethra, which causes the urine to emerge drop by drop. (It also referred to painful urination, I suppose from the expression on men’s faces when they tried to go.)</p><p class="cgs"><b>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</b></p><p class="ctx1">There is currently a tremendous difference of opinion as to the cause of BPH. Conventional medical thought is that the accumulation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate is the problem. As testosterone enters the prostate, more than 95 percent of it is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. This DHT binds strongly to androgenic receptors in the prostate. Because it is the DHT that stimulates growth of the prostate when testosterone levels rise just after birth and at puberty, physicians have come to believe that DHT is the cause of its growth in middle age. There are a number of problems with this perspective, the most obvious being that growth of the prostate in middle age is occurring as testosterone levels in the body begin to <i>fall,</i> not rise. Prostate growth earlier in life only occurred during increases in testosterone levels.</p><p>Standard medical intervention for BPH takes a two-pronged approach. The first is to relax the smooth muscle contractions in the prostate through the use of alpha-blocker drugs. This allows the urine to flow more freely and alleviates some of the symptoms of BPH. The second intervention is to prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT through the use of 5-alpha reductase blockers, usually the pharmaceutical Proscar (generic name finasteride).</p><p>Finasteride is usually of benefit only to men whose prostates are severely enlarged, from the size of a tomato to that of a grapefruit, which generally corresponds to Stage III or IV BPH. The drug needs to be taken for at least six months before there is any indication of effectiveness and usually one year for maximum effect. It does reduce DHT concentration in the prostate by some 80 percent, but the prostate only reduces its size by 18 percent in less than half of the men after one year of use. Only one-third to two-thirds of men (depending on the studies) show improvement in their symptoms.</p><p>Finasteride, in about 10 percent of men, causes impotence, decreased libido, and/or breast enlargement. It also decreases the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) that circulate in the blood. <i>Increased</i> PSA levels indicate the presence of prostate cancer about 70 percent of the time. This allows physicians to treat it before it spreads to other parts of the body. Finasteride interferes with the creation of PSA by normal prostate cells but not PSA created by prostate cancer cells. This means that men on the drug can show low levels of PSA even when they do have cancer. BPH is also considered to be a possible early indicator of eventual prostate cancer. Yet in at least one trial, men who take finasteride have been found to have an increased risk of prostate cancer.</p><p>Research is beginning to indicate, however, that the conversion of testosterone to DHT is not the reason behind inflammation of the prostate. Prostate growth, which in younger life is directly dependant on testosterone, begins to increase again in middle age exactly at the point when <i>testosterone levels begin to fall</i>. This later decrease in the body’s levels of free testosterone is amplified by the simultaneous increase in levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which binds up even more free testosterone and makes testosterone levels in the body fall even lower. For this reason alone, the assumption that DHT levels are the cause of prostate enlargement seems suspect. Several studies have even shown that men with enlarged prostates do not have higher levels of DHT than men without prostate enlargement. In fact, DHT levels in men with BPH were found to be slightly lower than in healthy men. Extensive studies have also been done to see if Chinese men, who generally have lower rates of BPH than American men, also have lower 5-alpha reductase activity in their prostates. The studies, which were designed to normalize the populations for numerous factors, found that Chinese and American men have the same levels of activity of 5-alpha reductase. The researchers commented that the studies indicate that the cause of BPH is environmental and dietary factors, <i>not</i> 5-alpha reductase activity. Something else is causing the epidemic of prostate enlargement in men.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Prostatitis</b></p><p class="ctx1">Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) is different than benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), although both are treated nearly the same with natural protocols. Prostatitis actually means an inflammation of the prostate gland, while BPH refers to a nonmalignant, abnormal growth in prostate tissue. Normally walnut-sized, during severe BPH, the prostate can literally grow to the size of a grapefruit. The degree of the growth in prostate tissue and the impact on quality of life are measured from Stage I (mild) to Stage IV (serious). Prostatitis is not usually accompanied by the same degree of prostate growth as that seen in BPH.</p><p>No one knows why most prostatitis occurs, less than 10 percent is caused by bacterial infections because it is difficult for bacteria to get into the prostate. Usually those that do are immediately killed by the body’s immune system—causing a short-term, limited condition called acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis occurs when the bacteria are not killed, their population is only decreased, and they continually cause problems. Both of these conditions are usually caused by a urinary tract infection in which, for a variety of reasons, the urine backflows into the prostate, infecting it as well. This can be helped by using herbs and supplements for BPH while adding a urinary antibacterial such as uva ursi. If the bacterial infection is severe, the protocol for a urinary tract infection should be followed (see chapter 6). Other forms of prostatitis (chronic and asymptomatic prostatitis) occur from no known causes. The prostate is just mildly inflamed, with or without symptoms. These more common forms of prostatitis respond very well to the same protocols that are used for BPH.</p></div><div id="c08s01.04"><p class="csht">E<small>STROGEN AND THE</small> P<small>ROSTATE</small></p><p class="ctx1">Very simply, the prostate contains two predominant types of tissues: stromal, which is composed mostly of smooth muscle and connective tissues, and glandular tissue, which is composed mostly of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells secrete prostate fluid and are also the site of most prostate cancers. Stromal tissues are the tissues that usually enlarge during BPH. (The glandular tissue enlargement that occurs during prostate cancer can cause the same symptoms as BPH. Both types of enlargement cause the urethra to squeeze shut.)</p><p>What researchers are discovering is that estrogens and androgens work together in the prostate to regulate its function. New findings show that while estrogens directly affect stromal tissues, they also condition the response of epithelial tissues to androgens. When androgen and estrogen levels alter, especially estradiol, the most potent estrogen, the evidence now strongly suggests that the prostate gland’s tissues begin to grow in significantly different ways.</p><p>One study in Japan examined the levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and estradiol in men who participated in a large, mass screening for prostate disease. Although free testosterone and total testosterone levels were found to be irrelevant to prostate disease, the levels of estradiol and the ratio of estradiol to both types of testosterone were found to be significant indicators of prostate disease. The higher the level of estradiol and the higher its ratio to both free testosterone and total testosterone, the larger the prostate was found to be. Another study at Harvard Medical School supported the Japanese research when it found the most significant indicator of BPH to be the level of estradiol in the blood. Researchers have in fact found that prostate tissue from men with BPH converts androgens to estrogens (primarily estradiol) at extremely high levels compared to healthy prostate tissue. This indicates that the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estradiol, has become highly activated in their prostates. This is a cause for concern in that it results not only in higher estradiol levels but also in much lower concentrations of testosterone in the prostate. Other studies have found that vitamin D is actually an important steroid hormone with powerful impacts on the prostate. When testosterone levels are low, vitamin D potentiates abnormal prostate tissue growth. With sufficient testosterone levels, it promotes normal prostate growth and cellular health.</p><p>Higher estradiol levels are a concern because stromal cells (the cells that usually enlarge during BPH) are the primary target of estrogens in the prostate gland. As androgen levels fall in the aging male body, the activity of estrogen receptor genes increases, leading, in many men, to increased stromal cell growth. Estrogen has been found to be a specific messenger molecule for the prostate’s stromal tissue, initiating its growth. The impact of estrogen, especially estradiol, on stromal tissue has been found over and over again to be one of the primary factors in the development of BPH. During BPH, this estrogen-activated stromal tissue can increase up to two and a half times its normal ratio to other prostate tissues.</p><p>Increases in estrogen have also been linked with elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor, a protein that makes cells grow and prevents old cells from dying. High levels of insulin-like growth factor have been positively correlated with prostate cancer. Estradiol has been found to be the most potent estrogen that affects prostate tissues. It causes an eightfold increase of in the amount of intracellularcyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the prostate. This is a messenger molecule that is activated by hormones. Once activated, it initiates a wide range of activity within cells, including cellular growth. The level of cAMP is also directly correlated to the amount of PSA that the prostate cells release.</p><p>Androgens, especially testosterone, are converted into either DHT or estradiol through specific chemical pathways in the prostate. Part of the potential danger in focusing on 5-alpha reductase blockers is that they force testosterone and other androgens away from DHT conversion and into estradiol conversion, thus raising estradiol levels in the prostate. DHT, rather than stimulating prostate growth, tends to decrease estra-diol levels and estradiol’s impacts on prostate health. The primary factor emerging as most important in prostate disease is how much estradiol is either being taken in the diet (e.g., hopped beers) or how much estradiol is being made in the body or the prostate through the action of the aromatase enzyme. (Rises in estrogenic pollutants in the environment exactly parallel the increase in prostate disease in men.) Increased DHT levels, reduced aromatization, and reduced estradiol have all been correlated to better prostate health. <i>Because there is such controversy about the causes of prostate enlargement, you should explore the matter care</i><i>fully and make your own decisions.</i></p></div><div id="c08s01.05"><p class="csht">N<small>ATURAL</small> C<small>ARE FOR THE</small> P<small>ROSTATE</small></p><p class="ctx1">Natural protocols for prostate disease are very effective. In Europe, they are the treatments of choice in 90 to 95 percent of cases. They work as well as they do, not because they interfere with the conversion of testosterone to DHT, but because they relax the muscle tissue in the prostate allowing urine to flow more easily. They also act as a prostate-specific anti-inflammatory, block the conversion of testosterone to estradiol, and normalize hormonal activity in the prostate. Natural treatment protocols are much cheaper than pharmaceuticals, do not have to be taken forever, tend to lower the risk of prostate cancer, and have few side effects when compared to pharmaceuticals. Because they possess such strong anti-inflammatory actions, these herbs are also specific for prostatitis.</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="centtb"><b>Natural Care for Prostatitis and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Suggested dosage for three to twelve months:</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Nettle root:</b> 300–600 mg twice a day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Saw palmetto:</b> 160 mg of standardized extract twice a day</p><p class="blockts"><b>Rye grass pollen (Cernilton or an equivalent):</b> 60–120 mg twice a day, especially for people with prostatitis</p><p class="blockts"><b>Omega-3 fatty acids:</b> 1 Tbl. of flaxseed oil daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>Zinc:</b> 50 mg per day</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Nettle Root <i>(Urtica dioica)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">As discussed previously in chapter 4, nettle root has been used to treat both BPH and prostatitis in at least thirty clinical studies. Participants in the studies ranged from as few as twenty men to as many as 5,400. In men with Stage I–III BPH, nettle root consistently: reduced nighttime urination (nocturia), improved urine stream, decreased urine remaining in bladder after urination, decreased prostate size, and significantly lowered the score on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire (this rates the degree of negative impacts the prostate inflammation is causing in urination in seven areas plus overall quality of life). A number of the trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies.</p><p>As only a few examples:</p><p>Sixty-one to 83 percent of 5,492 men who used 1200 mg of nettle root daily for 3 to 4 months found significant relief from BPH symptoms. In twenty-six men who used 1200 mg daily of a nettle root daily, prostate volume decreased in 54 percent and residual volume of urine in 75 percent.</p><p>Seventy-nine men who used 600 mg per day for sixty-eight weeks (sixteen months) found that urine flow significantly increased and urination time significantly decreased.</p><p>Twenty patients who used a combination nettle root/saw palmetto in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial found their flow rate significantly improved over placebo. Their IPSS scores declined from 18.6 to 11.1 but with continued use continued to decline even lower to 9.8. The study found that continued use of herbs increases prostate shrinkage <i>over time,</i> improving prostate health the longer they are used. The same study compared 489 men with others using finasteride (Proscar) over a forty-eight week period and found that IPSS scores dropped similarly in both groups but with fewer side-effects in the men using herbal extracts.</p><p>Needle biopsies were taken in a number of studies to discover exactly what was happening to the prostate in men taking nettle root. Researchers found that nettle root reduced the activity of the smooth muscle cells in the prostate, caused a shrinkage of both the smooth muscle tissue and the epithelial or glandular tissue, and increased epithelial secretions.</p><p>Nettle root has been found to be consistently anti-inflammatory (both to the prostate and other tissues), to inhibit sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), to inhibit DHT binding to SHBG, and to be antiaromatase (inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estradiol).</p><p>The herb contains a number of powerful chemical constituents that are either unique to this plant, unique in these quantities, or in these combinations. Of note are histamine, formic acid, acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and various glucoquinones. Nettle is also exceptionally high in a number of vitamins and minerals, including zinc, and contains more protein than any other land plant.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Capsule: Dosage ranges from 300 mg to 1200 mg per day of <i>nettle root</i> for three to twelve months in the majority of the clinical trials. Tincture: Dosage range is ¼ to 2 tsp. daily of a forty-five percent alcohol/water tincture for one to twelve months.</p><p>Make sure in buying capsules and tinctures that you get the root and <i>not</i> the plant as each is used for different conditions. The root is often combined with saw palmetto. A significant number of effective trials have been carried out on this type of combination.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> Mild side effects have occasionally been reported with the root, usually mild gastrointestinal upset. With the plant, only mild side effects are noted: skin afflictions such as rashes and mild swelling. The Physicians’ Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines (PDR) lists a contraindication for the plant in cases of fluid retention from reduced cardiac or renal action. No contraindications are noted for the root.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> May potentiate the actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Saw Palmetto <i>(Serenoa ripens)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Arecaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Berries</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Saw Palmetto:</b> Saw palmetto is listed in the German Commission E Monographs and the U.S. Physicians Desk Reference for Herbs as well as numerous herbals as being an antiandrogenic herb. This could easily raise concern for men wishing to restore androgenic levels in their bodies. However, those sources are incorrect. In actuality, saw palmetto is an <i>endocrine</i> agent, more specifically one that exerts steroidogenic normalizing actions on the prostate. Saw palmetto blocks both testosterone and DHT from binding to androgen receptors, but <i>it also blocks the action of estrogen in the prostate, interfering with the binding of estradiol to estrogenic receptors.</i> More technically, the herb suppresses expression of nuclear estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors in the prostate. Saw palmetto, in essence, successfully competes for both androgenic and estrogenic receptors in the prostate. This makes the herb a prostate tonic—which hormonal receptors it affects depends on how the prostate is malfunctioning. By interfering with the steroid hormones that are overactive, saw palmetto normalizes hormone action within the prostate gland and reduces cell proliferation and prostate growth. Although saw palmetto (and nettle root as well) does inhibit 5-alpha reductase, it and nettle root are both some 5,600 times less powerful than the drug finasteride (Proscar), lending considerable weight to the speculation that this action of saw palmetto is unrelated to its positive actions in the treatment of BPH. In fact, while saw palmetto has been found to lower the concentration of DHT in prostate tissue by as much as 50 percent, studies have shown that, at the same time, 5-alpha reductase activity in the prostate is unaffected.</p><p>Importantly, saw palmetto is also an anti-inflammatory through at least three different chemical mechanisms, which helps the prostate to decrease in size. It has been found to significantly reduce epidermal growth factor in the periurethral region of the prostate—the region of the prostate that surrounds the urethra as it comes down from the bladder. It is also an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, which means that is relaxes smooth muscles throughout the body, including the prostate. These mechanisms alleviate the pressure of the prostate on the urethra, easing symptoms.</p><p>Saw palmetto has been used in at least twenty clinical studies ranging in size from fourteen to 1,300 men and has consistently shown effectiveness in reducing prostate problems. Of the men using saw palmetto in clinical trials, 80 to 90 percent report significant improvement in their prostate problems. Researchers have noted that for most men using the herb (89 percent) urinary flow increases, actual size of prostate decreases, and prostate symptom scores all decrease. <i>In general, the herb needs to be used for from forty-five to ninety days to produce benefits. The longer it is used, the more benefit is achieved.</i></p><p>In one study, 505 men with Stage I to III BPH took 160 mg of saw palmetto twice daily for three months. Urine flow increased by 25 percent after ninety days, the amount of urine remaining in the bladder decreased by 20 percent, and the prostate reduced in size by 10 percent. Results on the International Prostate Symptom Score decreased by 35 percent. Another, four-month study with 1,334 men found that residual urine volume decreased by 37 percent and nighttime urination decreased by 54 percent. Half the men who had experienced painful urination before the trial reported relief.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Standardized extract/capsules: Standardized to 85 to 95 percent fatty acids and sterols, take two 160-mg capsules of extract twice a day. Powdered and encapsulated freshly dried berries: 1 to 2 g one or two times per day.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> Rarely saw palmetto will produce stomach upset and nausea.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None currently known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Rye Grass Pollen <i>(Secale cereale)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Gramineae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Pollen</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Rye Grass:</b> Rye grass pollen has been used in Europe for prostatic, arthritic, and cholesterol problems for nearly fifty years with tremendous success. The pollen is generally sold in proprietary formulations under names like Cernilton or Cernitin. Interestingly, while 92 percent of the formulation is rye grass pollen, 5 percent comes from timothy grass <i>(Phleum pratense)</i> and 3 percent from corn pollen <i>(Zea mays).</i> Corn pollen has been used as a longevity tonic for men and contains many of the same constituents as pine pollen.</p><p>The pollens are collected mechanically and processed through a two-stage process into pill form. Numerous clinical trials and hundreds of studies have shown this rye grass pollen combination to possess significant anti-inflammatory activity, to be a prostate tonic and normalizer, to lower cholesterol, and to be antiarthritic. Studies have consistently shown that this combination of grass pollens has a specific growth-inhibiting effect on prostatic epithelial cells and fibroblasts and that it is consistently effective in the treatment of BPH.</p><p>In one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, fifty-seven men with BPH received either Cernilton or placebo daily. Seventy percent of the men in the Cernilton group reported significant improvement in symptoms, 60 percent of them reported improvements in bladder emptying, and most experienced a shrinkage of prostate tissues. Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 103 men with Stage II or III BPH found that after taking 138 mg per day for twelve weeks, 69 percent of the men experienced relief of symptoms in six different categories. Another study with sixty men who took 92 mg for six months found similar outcomes.</p><p>Cernilton has been found to be as effective in the treatment of prostatitis as it has been for BPH. From 75 to 80 percent of men in clinical trials of Cernilton report relief from nonbacterial-related prostatitis. In one trial, men taking three tablets daily of a rye grass pollen extract experienced significantly reduced symptoms.</p><p>A limited number of studies have shown that this combination of pollens in Cernilton is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 60 to 120 mg two or three times daily. The dosage for rye grass pollen varies considerably. From 80 mg a day to 500 mg three times a day have been used by various clinicians and in various studies. The usual dosage range in clinical studies is three to six tablets or four capsules per day. Tablets are usually 50 to 60 mg.</p><p>Rye grass pollen is available under several commercial names Cernilton, Cernitin, and Prostaphil as several examples. Cernilton seems to be the most common (see the Resource section for sources).</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> This herb is contraindicated for those with pollen sensitivity.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Herb/Drug Interactions:</b> None currently known.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</b></p><p class="ctx1">In vitro studies have shown that omega-6 fatty acids actually stimulate prostate cell growth while omega-3 fatty acids inhibit it. This finding seems to transfer directly to people. Inuit/Yupik men who eat a lot of fish have significantly lower risks of prostate cancer than those who do not. One study with nineteen men found that an increase in omega-3 fatty acids for several weeks resulted in diminished residual urine in nineteen and elimination of residual urine in twelve; elimination of nighttime urination for thirteen; elimination of dribbling in eighteen men; increased urine stream in all men; reduction in the size of the prostate gland in all men; decreased fatigue and leg pain in all men; and increased libido in all men.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Although you can buy omega-3 oil in capsules, perhaps the easiest way to take it is as flaxseed oil, 1 Tbl. daily. <b>Note:</b> Cold-water fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. This includes mackerel, albacore tuna, sardines, salmon, and so on. If you do choose to eat salmon, try to get wild salmon. Most salmon sold in the United States are raised in pens and are nearly always treated with large quantities of antibiotics and growth enhancers.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Zinc</b></p><p class="ctx1">Zinc intake has been found to shrink the prostate and alleviate symptoms for men with BPH. Several studies have found that the use of zinc for as little as two months results in a decrease of symptoms of BPH. In one study with nineteen men, fourteen of them experienced shrinkage of the prostate as measured by palpation, x-ray, and endoscopy.</p><p>Interestingly, high levels of estrogen in the body interfere with zinc uptake in the intestinal tract. Not only do estrogens affect male sexual functioning but by lowering the uptake of zinc they also reduce male sexual functioning even further. Androgens, on the other hand, significantly enhance zinc uptake.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 20 to 40 mg per day.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Things To Avoid</b></p><p class="ctx1">Hops and beer. The potent estrogen, estradiol, found in large quantities in hops, plays a powerful role in increasing prostate size and is strongly implicated in both BPH and prostate cancer. Hopped beer should be avoided at all cost. Some studies have found that beer consumption is directly related to prostate inflammation.</p><p>Other estrogenic plants such as licorice and black cohosh should be avoided as well.</p></div></div></body></html>
