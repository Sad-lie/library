Cleansing Diet</b></p><p class="cepi"><i>We eat the way we live. What we do with food, we do in our lives. Eating is a stage upon which we act out our beliefs about ourselves.</i></p><p class="ceps">G<small>ENEEN</small> R<small>OTH</small></p><p class="ctx4">The following diet is exceptionally good as a general weight-loss plan if you want to reduce your body mass index and waist circumference—two factors that are strongly linked to a higher ratio of estrogen to testosterone. Altering those factors will naturally increase the testosterone in the male body. One of the nice parts of this diet is that you can eat as much as you want, which helps reduce feelings of deprivation. The weight loss and the clearing of body sluggishness that occurs with this kind of diet are enhanced considerably if you immediately follow it with a juice fast for three to ten days. Energy and androgen levels will increase substantially. Two cleansing blends that I have had great success with are discussed immediately after the diet.</p><div id="apps01.01"><p class="csht">T<small>HE</small> C<small>LEANSING</small> D<small>IET</small></p><ol class="1"><li>Drink 4 to 6 glasses of water every day. Do not use tap water.</li><li>Eliminate dairy products, eggs, and sweets.</li><li>Eat only <i>whole</i> grains (brown rice, millet, barley, oats, quinoa, and so on), organic beans, lightly steamed organic vegetables and fruit, and minimal amounts of wild or free-range meats. Tempeh and tofu are excellent. <i>Do not cook any grains with oil.</i></li><li>Use only olive oil for cooking. Use no more than 2 Tbl. of oil per day. Do not use butter or margarine of any kind.</li><li>Drink all the fresh vegetable and fruit juices you like.</li><li>Do not use salt. Any other spices you wish to use are okay, as are small amounts of tamari and soy.</li><li>Do not use any caffeinated drinks (except green tea), alcohol, or recreational drugs during the diet. If you are a heavy caffeine drinker, instead of stopping cold turkey, go from coffee to black tea to green tea over a one- to two-week period of time.</li><li>Eat fruits first and by themselves. They digest rapidly and, when eaten with other foods, are held in the stomach where they can cause gas and intestinal upset.</li><li>Do not eat any fried foods.</li><li>Consider consuming a “green drink” each morning. Many of these are powdered and must be mixed into juice and blended. A fresh green drink recipe is described in chapter 6 (see Androgen/Adrenal Green Drink recipe, page 79).</li></ol></div><div id="apps01.02"><p class="csht">F<small>OOD</small> L<small>IST</small></p><p class="ctx1"><i>Buy only organic, pesticide-free foods.</i> This is important. The chemicals in non-organically farmed foods will be taken into the body, where they can have powerful impacts. You are working to lessen your toxin load, organic foods remove one common source of toxins that are often hard for the liver to process. This takes the load off the liver and allows it to work more efficiently in helping your body detoxify.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Fruits:</b></span> Eat any fruits you wish.</p><table><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Vegetables:</b></td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">acorn squash</td><td class="tdtms">cucumber</td><td class="tdtms">rutabagas</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">artichoke</td><td class="tdtms">daikon</td><td class="tdtms">snow peas</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">asparagus</td><td class="tdtms">daikon greens</td><td class="tdtms">spinach</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">avocados</td><td class="tdtms">eggplant</td><td class="tdtms">string beans</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">beets</td><td class="tdtms">jicama</td><td class="tdtms">sweet potatoes</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">broccoli</td><td class="tdtms">kale</td><td class="tdtms">Swiss chard</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">Brussels sprouts</td><td class="tdtms">red leaf lettuce</td><td class="tdtms">summer squash</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">burdock</td><td class="tdtms">romaine lettuce</td><td class="tdtms">sprouts</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">butternut squash</td><td class="tdtms">mustard greens</td><td class="tdtms">tomatoes</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">cabbage</td><td class="tdtms">onion</td><td class="tdtms">turnips</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">carrots, raw or cooked</td><td class="tdtms">potatoes, red or white</td><td class="tdtms">turnip greens</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">cauliflower</td><td class="tdtms">parsley</td><td class="tdtms">watercress</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">celery</td><td class="tdtms">parsnips</td><td class="tdtms">zucchini</td></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">collard greens</td><td class="tdtms">pumpkins</td><td class="tdtms"/></tr><tr><td class="tdtms">corn</td><td class="tdtms">red radish</td><td class="tdtms"/></tr></table><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Oil:</b></span> Use olive oil for cooking. Flaxseed oil, because of its high levels of omega-3 oils, is a very good oil to use (uncooked) for such things as salad dressings.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Salad Dressing:</b></span> Herbed vinegar, champagne, wine, or fruit vinegars only—combine with flaxseed oil if desired.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Seasonings:</b></span> Any except salt.</p><p class="ctx4s"><b>Beverages:</b></p><p class="bibtx">Water: Filtered or artisan spring water.

If you feel you want fowl, use only range-fed, pharmaceutical-free, organic chickens (or other birds). Wild meats such as venison or elk are excellent; if they are farmed they should be organic. Meat should be eaten only once or twice a week during the diet. <b>Note:</b> Salmon are almost always raised in pens in the sea. These fish are highly dosed with growth stimulants and antibiotics. They should be avoided. Eat only wild sea salmon. (Catfish are also farm raised.)</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Bread:</b></span> Use only sprouted-grain breads.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Cooking:</b></span> Use only stainless steel, enameled, or earthenware cooking utensils. Never use aluminum.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Sweetener:</b></span> Use pure maple syrup.

Maple syrup supplies nearly all the essential vitamins and minerals necessary for health.</p></div><div id="apps01.03"><p class="csht">M<small>EAL</small> P<small>LANNING</small></p><p class="ctx1">It is best to establish a routine for meals and a list of meals <i>before</i> you start on the diet. Cook a large pot of a grain of your choice and keep it in the refrigerator. This way if you get hungry, there is already something available.</p><p>Eat as much as you wish throughout the day. Fruit is good as a snack food. Have it available to eat whenever you feel hungry. It is helpful to get a good vegetarian cookbook and plan out a week’s meals.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Sample Daily Menus</b></p><p class="ctx1"><span class="is"><b>Breakfast:</b></span> 1) Herbal tea, oatmeal with raisins and maple syrup. 2) Fruit salad. 3) Powdered or fresh Green Drink.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Lunch:</b></span> 1) Vegetable soup, sprouted bread. 2) Rice and steamed vegetables with tamari.</p><p class="ctx4"><span class="is"><b>Dinner:</b></span> 1) Steamed vegetables or vegetable casserole, grain of choice, salad with herbed vinegar. 2) Steamed salmon with dill and lime, steamed asparagus, wild green salad with snow peas and radish.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Powdered Green Drinks</b></p><p class="ctx1">“Green drinks” have become more popular of late, and a number of types are readily available in health food stores and on the Internet. You can buy them premixed (follow directions on the container) or make them yourself. The one I make contains two parts each of spirulina, Siberian ginseng, nettle leaf, astragalus, turmeric, dandelion root, and milk thistle seed and one part each of chlorella, bladderwrack (a seaweed), burdock, and ashwaghanda. I add <sup>1</sup>/3 cup of the powdered mixture to 12 oz of apple juice, 1 Tbl. of flaxseed oil and blend, then drink. It is more effective if you begin blending the apple juice first, then add the oil and powdered herbs. Otherwise it clumps. This drink is just about as healthy a thing as you can take, and it is very filling, especially if taken at breakfast.</p><p class="cgs"><b>Things to Remember</b></p><ol class="1"><li>It is normal to feel a sensation that is usually described as hunger no matter how much you eat in the early days to two weeks of this kind of diet. It is not actually hunger but the shift away from a high carbohydrate/glucose diet. During this time, your body will begin using more fat stores, shifting partially into ketosis (the burning of fat as a fuel, rather than glucose), to make up the calorie difference. By the end of the diet, most people generally feel increased energy, more mental alertness, and little hunger. They eat smaller portions, are highly relaxed, and have lower stress levels.</li><li>You may feel lightheaded. This is also normal.</li><li>Because eating is such a social event, it is normal to feel left out when others go out to eat. Go with them and convince them to go to a good health food restaurant. Order foods from the Food List (beginning on page 134) and that are light on oils.</li><li>When others order alcohol and you also wish to drink, order sparkling water with a lime in a champagne glass.</li><li>Emotional issues often arise during any change in eating patterns, especially when the body is using up its stores of fat. Remember that this is normal, and make no major life decisions during this time. Remember, this, too, shall pass.</li></ol></div><div id="apps01.04"><p class="csht">C<small>LEANSING</small> B<small>LENDS</small> O<small>NE AND</small> T<small>WO</small></p><p class="ctx1">These two cleansing blends differ in their impacts. The first is strongly energetic and stimulating; the second is more tonic, nutritive, and gently supportive. The first is best used only short-term for fasts of up to ten days in length. The second is great for both short-term and longer fasts of ten to forty-five days. The first blend, which is also very good for colds and flu, is especially effective in stimulating the circulatory system. This helps support both the liver and kidneys in detoxifying the body. The second blend, often known as the Master Cleanser Diet (created by Stanley Burroughs), is a very good choice if you have not fasted before. It will give you enough energy to work and carry out daily tasks, most or all of the necessary bodily nutrients are provided, and it is very easy to make and use—there is no need for juicing at all. Some people simply fill a nipple-fitted, quart water bottle and carry it with them all day, drinking the blend whenever desired. <b>Note:</b> Do not substitute honey for maple syrup in Cleansing Blend Two; it is not as effective.</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="centtb"><b>Cleansing Blend One</b></p><p class="blockts">10 oz spring water, hot</p><p class="blockts">4–5 oz fresh ginger root, juiced</p><p class="blockts">¼ fresh lime, squeezed into drink</p><p class="blockts">1 Tbl. organic wildflower honey</p><p class="blockts"><small><sup>1</sup>⁄16</small>–⅛ tsp. cayenne</p><p class="blockpst"><b>Directions</b></p><p class="blockps">Add juiced ginger, squeezed lime and its juice, honey, and cayenne to hot water.

It is somewhat high in the B vitamins, particularly thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. It also contains a fair amount of vitamin C.</p><p>Ginger is primarily a circulatory herb with pronounced effects on the heart and blood. It causes the blood vessels to relax and expand, thus lowering blood pressure and allowing the heart to beat stronger and more slowly as it pumps the blood throughout the body. This means that the blood is pumped more efficiently. Japanese researchers have found that blood pressure typically lowers 10 to 15 percent after ingesting ginger. Indian researchers have found that ginger is effective in lowering the cholesterol content of the blood. Dutch researchers have noted it to be efficient in preventing the blood from clotting, similar in effectiveness to aspirin. Ginger also soothes the stomach, helping to relieve indigestion and stimulate healthy digestion. It relieves gas, flatulence, and cramping and facilitates absorption of foods in the stomach. A number of researchers have found that ginger is highly effective in alleviating motion sickness, nausea, and vomiting, being more effective than Dramamine, the usual drug of choice for those conditions. It has also been shown to be quite effective for morning sickness. Numerous studies have shown that ginger alleviates the symptoms of arthritis.</p><p>Ginger is a potent inhibitor of the inflammatory compounds known as prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which is one of the reasons why it so powerfully helps alleviate arthritic conditions. It is also a strong antioxidant and contains a protein-digesting enzyme (a protease) that appears to have strong impacts on inflammatory processes in the body.</p><p>Ginger is highly antibacterial with potent activity against a number of human pathogenic bacteria as well as the food-borne bacteria shigella, E. coli, and salmonella. Its antitussive (anticough) action rivals that of codeine, and it is a strong expectorant which helps move bronchial mucus up and out of the system.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Start with a piece about the size of your thumb and work up. You can either grate the fresh ginger and then steep it in hot water for twenty to thirty minutes or juice it in a juicer and simply add the juice to the hot water. I usually juice it.</p><p>Many people start with about 1 oz of juice in 6 to 8 oz water and then increase the amount of juiced ginger as desired and as they become used to it. I prefer 4 to 5 oz at this point, but I really like it spicy and I really enjoy the effects of ginger on my metabolism. I also save the juiced pulp and steep it in 6 to 8 oz of hot water for a second cup later in the day. I find this to be as strong a tea as that from the original juice. Drink three to six times daily, more if desired.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Lime <i>(Citrus aurantifolia) or Lemon (Citrus lemon)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Rutaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Fruit</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Limes and Lemons:</b> One-quarter of a lime contains 4 mg calcium, 20 mg potassium, 2 mg phosphorous, 5 mg vitamin C, 0.25 mg sodium, 1 mg magnesium, and varying trace amounts of iron, vitamin A, B-complex vitamins, germanium, tin, selenium, and zinc. Lemons are a bit higher in most of these constituents, mostly due to their larger size. Limes and lemons are strongly antibacterial and antimicrobial. They also contain (especially in the peels) compounds known as flavonoids, including rutin. These compounds affect vascular permeability. Essentially, they strengthen the walls of capillaries and blood vessels. This helps reduce the occurrence of varicose veins, for instance, and plays a role in preventing stroke and hemorrhoids. Limes are mildly anti-inflammatory and diuretic; they help increase urine production and flow. Limes (and lemons) also contain limonene that, while it helps dissolve gallstones, is also showing a great deal of promise in both preventing and treating cancer. It strongly enhances both phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes in the liver. This is not only effective in helping treat and prevent cancer, but is especially good for helping enhance the liver’s ability to process the body’s accumulated toxins. Limonene is specifically necessary for the parts of the phase II detoxification system that work through glutathione conjugation and glucuronidation. These two processes deactivate acetaminophen, nicotine, organophosphates (insecticides), various carcinogens, and a number of pharmaceuticals, thus protecting liver integrity.</p><p>Limonene is mostly present in the white, spongy inner pith (between the peel and the inner fruit) of limes and lemons. Because the peel and pith are so bioactive, it is more beneficial to squeeze the juice from a lime or lemon wedge into the drink, then drop the wedge in as well and let it steep.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> One-quarter fresh lime squeezed into glass and dropped into glass as well. Lemon can be used interchangeably, I just like the taste of lime better in Cleansing Blend One.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Cayenne <i>(Capsicum minimum)</i></b></p><p class="ctx2"><b>Family:</b> Solanaceae</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Part Used:</b> Fruit</p><p class="ctx4"><b>About Cayenne:</b> Cayenne is extremely high in vitamin C, copper, and phosphorous; high in vitamin A; and a good source of bioflavonoids, potassium, and vitamin E.</p><p>Cayenne increases the body’s metabolic rate, in some studies, by as much as 25 percent. This causes the body to burn more fat as fuel and makes cayenne especially helpful in increasing weight loss when taken during fasting. It also increases blood circulation, dilates capillaries, increases blood flow to outlying portions of the body, and lowers blood pressure. These actions make it especially useful during cleansing fasts. Cayenne is also a potent pain reliever. It contains capsaicin, a compound that stimulates the release of endorphins, the body’s natural pain relievers. A number of studies have found it to be exceptionally effective in the treatment of cluster headaches and the pain of arthritis. Cayenne is also a powerful antiseptic and breaks up mucous throughout the respiratory tract and helps it move up and out of the system.</p><p>Because fasting can sometimes be accompanied by joint pain or headaches and is almost always accompanied by coldness in the extremities, cayenne’s effects make it an excellent herb to use during a fast.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> <small><sup>1</sup>⁄16</small> to ⅛ tsp. per cup of water. <b>Warning:</b> Be careful that you don’t get the cayenne on your hands. If you do, wash them thoroughly afterward. Otherwise, before you know it, you will rub your eyes or go to the bathroom and find yourself burning in whichever area you have touched.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Honey</b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>About Honey:</b> Honey is made from the nectar of the flowers of plants that is gathered by bees. Plant nectars contain sucrose, water, amino acids, proteins, lipids, antioxidants, alkaloids, glycosides, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxin, biotin, folic acid, medoinositol, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, a-ketoglutaric acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, allantoin, allantoic acid, dextrin, formic acid, a wide range of vitamins and minerals, and other unidentified compounds.</p><p>The sugar in plant nectars is primarily sucrose, a disaccharide. Sucrose (most commonly experienced as white table sugar) is a double-molecule sugar that is made from one fructose molecule and one glucose molecule linked together. When bees harvest plant nectars, they hold them in their stomachs for transport to the hive. During transport, their stomach enzymes take the sucrose molecule and break it apart into glucose and fructose.</p><p>These two primary sugars in honey are monosaccharides (simple sugars) and, as a result, do not require additional processing by the body to be digested. White sugar, which is a disaccharide, takes considerably more work to be digested. Other than the sugar in fruits, honey, and the plant nectars it comes from, is the most ancient form of sugar concentrate that the human species has used.</p><p>Historically, honeys came from a profusion of wildflowers, whatever grew locally. It was exceedingly uncommon to have a honey gathered from a single species of plant, such as the alfalfa or clover honeys of today, unless that plant species existed in great abundance (as was the case with heather). Because of this, the wildflower honeys that humans have used throughout their evolutionary history have contained trace amounts of the medicinal compounds produced by a multitude of wild plants. Honeybees show a great attraction for many strongly medicinal plants, including vitex, jojoba, elder, toadflax, balsam root, echinacea, valerian, dandelion, and wild geranium. In fact, this includes almost any flowering medicinal herb as well as the more commonly known alfalfas and clovers. These plant compounds, although present in tiny quantities, remain highly bioactive.</p><p>Honey is not just another simple carbohydrate like white sugar is. It is composed of a highly complex collection of enzymes, plant pigments, organic acids, esters, antibiotic agents, and trace minerals. Honey, in fact, contains more than seventy-five different compounds. In addition to those already listed, it contains proteins, carbohydrates, hormones, and antimicrobial compounds. One pound of non-heather honey contains 1,333 calories (compared with white sugar at 1,748 calories), 1.4 g of protein, 23 mg of calcium, 73 mg of phosphorus, 4.1 mg of iron, 1 mg of niacin, and 16 mg of vitamin C. The content of each of these substances varies considerably depending on which type of plants the honey is gathered from; some types of honey may contain as much as 300 mg of vitamin C per 100 g of honey. Honey also contains vitamin A, beta-carotene, the complete complex of B vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, magnesium, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, iodine, sodium, copper, manganese, and a rich supply of live enzymes. It also contains relatively high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, and many of the remaining substances in honey are so complex that they have yet to be identified. It has been found to possess antibiotic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, expectorant, antifungal, immune-stimulating, antiallergenic, laxative, antianemic, and tonic properties. Because honey increases calcium absorption in the body, it is also recommended for women in menopause to help prevent osteoporosis. In clinical trials, honey has been found to be especially effective in treating stomach ulceration (especially if caused by <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> bacteria), infected wounds, severe skin ulceration, and respiratory illnesses. A Bulgarian study of 17,862 patients found that honey was effective in improving chronic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, chronic and allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis.</p><p>Honey is a reliable, stable source of vitamins and minerals. Although high in vitamins, fruits and vegetables tend to lose them over time. Spinach, for instance, loses 50 percent of its vitamin-C content within twenty-four hours of picking. Honey, on the other hand, stores its vitamins indefinitely. Wildflower honeys generally have the largest overall concentration of vitamins. Single-plant honeys tend to increase concentrations of one vitamin to the detriment of others.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 1 Tbl. per cup of tea. Generally, raw, unprocessed, and unpasteurized wildflower honey should be used. Single-plant honeys such as those made from alfalfa and clover are generally from high-technology, monocropped fields that are doused with large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers. Use only organic wildflower honeys.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects and Contraindications:</b> Occasionally, uncooked honeys can contain botulism spores that can be dangerous to children under one year of age. The human digestive system is more developed and able to deactivate the spores after about age one. In rare instances, people who are allergic to bee stings or who have pollen sensitivity may react negatively to honey. If you have a history of these kinds of allergic reactions, avoid honey.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Maple Syrup <i>(Acer saccharum)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1"><b>About Maple Syrup:</b> Sap from the sugar maple is virtually the only tree sap still used in the United States. Originally, the members of indigenous cultures in North America, like many indigenous peoples, tapped a wide variety of trees—not only all the maples (6 species) and birches (6 species) but also butternut and hickory trees. These saps were used not only as syrups—made by boiling them down—but as tonic drinks, as medicines.</p><p>Maple is rarely used in contemporary herbalism, but early New Englanders often drank the fresh sap as a primary spring tonic. (From the time I spent living in Vermont, I find that many maple sap harvesters still do.) Maple sap, and the syrup that comes from it, is one of the most complete nutrient foods known. It is possible to live for many weeks without any adverse physical effects while eating only maple syrup. It is high in calories, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.It also contains significant amounts of many other B vitamins and iron. Maple sap has traditionally been used, both internally and externally, as a general tonic, for skin conditions such as hives and stubborn wounds, as a kidney medicine and tonic, as a diuretic, as a cough remedy, for cramping, and as a blood purifier.</p><p>Because of its complex nutritional makeup, effectiveness as a general system tonic, and impacts on the kidney system, maple syrup is especially useful when used long-term for fasting.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 2 Tbl. in 10 oz of water daily as often as desired.</p></div></div></body></html>
