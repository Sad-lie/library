Initially, there was tremendous excitement among physicians and athletes (weight lifters and muscle builders especially) and pharmaceutical steroids were widely prescribed. Unfortunately, many of the people who used the synthetic steroids (testosterone propionate, testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone undecanoate, and so on) became quite ill some years later, some dying from liver disease or cancer. The negative impacts from these artificial steroids are the result of how they are produced.</p><p>As with many synthetic pharmaceuticals, the natural molecule, testosterone in this instance, is altered just enough (toward the direction of being longer-lasting, more assimilatable, or more potent) so that a patent can be obtained. What manufacturers basically do is tack on an extra molecule to the testosterone molecule. As with all synthetic pharmaceuticals, the human body takes what it knows from its long evolutionary history (in this case, the testosterone molecule), separates it from any alien molecular structures, uses the testosterone, and is left with the problem of getting rid of the remaining molecular fragments. These leftover molecular fragments are often processed in the liver and are the source of the toxicity associated with anabolic steroids. As Jonathan Wright, M.D., coauthor of <i>Maximize Your Vitality and Potency for Men Over 40,</i> comments: “Call them what you will, hormone-like drugs are most definitely not hormones, and they <i>never</i> work exactly like natural hormones.”<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr23"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt23">1</a></sup></p><p>Because of the toxicity of artificial hormones, many people began exploring the use of natural hormones that do not possess the toxicity of synthetic anabolic steroidal drugs. The alternatives they found were <i>natural</i> prohormonal substances, which synthetic drugs are not. Unfortunately, most of these natural androgenic supplements, <i>identical</i> to the hormones produced in the human body, were outlawed in the United States in January 2005 with the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act—supposedly to protect children from buying them. Despite their exceptional safety record, the outcry over prohormone use in sports stimulated a more aggressive than normal form of puritanitis (spasming of the Puritan reflex) in the Congress and presidency.</p><p>Of the following supplements: pregnenolone, DHEA, zinc, vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub>, androstenedione, and DHT, only the first four are still legal as individual supplements in the United States. Information on androstenedione is included because it is one of the constituents found in pine pollen and it makes sense to understand what the constituent does for male health. Information on DHT is included because of the bad press it has received. The negative information on DHT, its relation to prostate enlargement and male health in general, that is prevalent in the U.S. culture today, is incorrect. This is a small attempt to begin rectifying that problem. Like cholesterol, DHT is being demonized, and will eventually be understood to be critically important in male health. In fact, DHT suppressors can, like cholesterol suppressors, cause more harm than good.</p><p>The supplements listed in this chapter have all been found to increase testosterone levels in the blood and help restore a healthy androgen/estrogen ratio. Some men prefer to use testosterone in the form of injections, patches, implants, creams, or sublingual pills, rather than testosterone precursors or natural androgens such as the ones that follow. If you would like more information on that approach, the two best books are <i>Maximize Your Vitality and Potency for Men Over 40</i> and Eugene Shippen and William Fryer’s <i>The Testosterone Syndrome.</i></p><p>In seeking out natural androgenic supplements, you should make sure you are getting pure pharmaceutical-grade supplements and nothing else. Many of these supplements are made from the Mexican wild yam <i>(Dioscorea spp.),</i> and some confusion has arisen as a result. Some people recommend the use of wild yam itself as a steroidal precursor, however, the human body cannot alter the compounds in wild yam into testosterone or any testosterone precursors. Wild yam is completely ineffective as a “natural” hormone for men or women unless its compounds have been extracted and chemically altered or processed in a laboratory.</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="centtb"><b>Supplements to Increase Testosterone Levels</b></p><p class="blockts"><b>Pregnenolone:</b> 50–100 mg daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>DHEA:</b> 25–50 mg daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>Zinc:</b> 20–60 mg daily</p><p class="blockts"><b>Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub>:</b> 100–500 mg daily</p><p class="center"><img alt="image" src="images/img_4.jpg"/></p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Pregnenolone</b></p><p class="ctx1">Pregnenolone is the first metabolite of cholesterol—the first thing cholesterol is made into. Thus, it is the primary steroid hormone (in both women and men) from which all the others are made. For this reason, it is sometimes called a prohormone or the “mother” steroid. Despite its being recognized as an important steroidal metabolite of cholesterol, there hasn’t been much research on pregnenolone raising androgen levels. Although it is commonly used by many people for that purpose, it is not known whether in fact it does so. The primary effect of pregnenolone that is widely agreed upon is that it appears to enhance mental functioning. It acts as a mood elevator and a mild sharpener of the memory and senses. One placebo-controlled trial has shown that taking 50 mg of pregnenolone per day will reduce general fatigue levels by half and that the reduction continues for at least two weeks. In airline pilots, 50 mg of pregnenolone has been found to significantly enhance performance. It has also shown beneficial effects for arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Pregnenolone was also used extensively in the 1950s for treating collagen diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and sclerodoma that affect the collagen in bones and connective tissues. Numerous clinical trials and studies have shown its effectiveness for these kinds of conditions with decreases in pain, more mobility, and less stiffness.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> The dosage generally should be 5 to 50 mg per day. Anecdotal evidence has reported that doses as high as 500 mg per day may in some instances help with the extreme memory loss and mental fatigue (brain fog) that occurs from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This is not usually recommended because of pregnenolone’s side effects.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> Hyperalertness, irritability, mood changes, headaches, and insomnia sometimes occur, especially at high doses. <i>This can be exac</i><i>erbated markedly by coffee intake.</i> Reduce dosage or discontinue the supplement if these side effects occur.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</b></p><p class="ctx1">DHEA has been studied intensely in the past ten to twenty years. At least ten books about DHEA have been published, with scores more that discuss DHEA along with other supplements. While DHEA itself is only a mild androgen, it is the precursor for androstenedione and androstenediol, which are the precursors of testosterone, making it essential for testosterone production. In addition, it has shown significant positive effects on human health in almost every organ system in the body.</p><p>DHEA is the most abundant steroid in the human bloodstream; most of it (about 70 percent) is made from DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). The body essentially stores DHEA in a more stable form as DHEAS and converts it to DHEA (and then other androgens) whenever it is needed. Like testosterone, both DHEA and DHEAS levels decline over time, but much more quickly. Levels of DHEA reach a peak around a man’s twenty-fifth year, then decline by about 2 percent per year; by age eighty, there is only 10 to 15 percent of age twenty levels. Normal levels of DHEA in the blood are 250 to 650 mcg per deciliter (about one tenth of a quart) of blood; DHEAS levels are five hundred to one thousand times higher. (DHEAS and DHEA can be considered interchangeable when talking about their health effects.) People with levels of DHEA below 100 mcg per deciliter consistently show higher levels of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis.</p><p>Most DHEA is synthesized in the adrenal glands, about 10 percent is made in the testes, while the rest is made in the brain, the heart, and the liver. Because of its synthesis in the brain, DHEA is also considered to be a neurosteroid, having potent impacts on the central nervous system and brain function.</p><p>Contrary to earlier medical perspectives, it is now known that the brain can synthesize sex steroids. To some extent, this occurs in response to erotic imagery. Smell, also, can lead to increases. This has been demonstrated in rats where the smell of a female in estrous leads to significant increases of DHEA in the hypothalamus. (Men, exposed to tiny quantities of the sweat of a woman who is sexually excited, also experience increases in testosterone production.) However, the brain creates potent androgens for many reasons other than sex. They also play crucial roles in memory and neural activity in the brain and central nervous system, and DHEA is a crucial precursor to the creation of both androgens and estrogens in the brain.</p><p>DHEA is also metabolized in peripheral tissues to more active androgens and these levels never appear in the bloodstream. Basically, peripheral tissues in the human body make more active androgens from DHEA whenever they need them. Peripheral tissues in the body normally contain all the enzymes necessary to convert DHEA to androstenedione and then to testosterone. This allows potent androgens to be used at the site where they are most needed and perhaps explains how DHEA is able to affect so many different parts of the body. In essence, the androgens synthesized from DHEA exert their effects within the same cells where synthesis takes place, and these synthesized androgens are rarely released into general blood circulation, thus never showing up in blood tests. The parts of the body that are engaging in androgen synthesis are essentially using an extremely sophisticated biofeedback loop to determine exactly what levels of androgens are necessary and then making exactly what they need from the DHEA that normally circulates in the body. At least 30 to 50 percent of the total androgens in men are synthesized in peripheral tissues in just this way. The enzymes that are used for this androgen synthesis (or metabolic conversion) and the basic androgenic precursors, especially DHEA, are, thus, absolutely necessary for overall health.</p><p>Because DHEA can be converted to the estrogens estrone and estradiol, some people feel that DHEA is a potential problem when used in androgen-replacement therapy. No research has found this to occur; estrogen levels in men consistently remain unaffected by DHEA intake. For example, one study of sixty- to seventy-year-old men who received intramuscular DHEA injections showed increased levels of DHEA and androstenedione in their blood. <i>No change was found in their levels of estrone and estradiol</i>. Even with extremely high oral dosing of 1,600 mg per day in young, healthy men, levels of estrone, estradiol, and SHBG remained steady.</p><p>DHEA supplementation will generally increase levels of DHEA in the blood as well as serum androstenedione and testosterone. In one study, 25 mg of DHEA taken orally each day for one year led to higher serum DHEAS levels and higher levels of testosterone in a young man suffering from hypogonadism (severely low functioning testes). Overall, DHEA supplementation increases androgen levels in peripheral tissues, increases serum androstenedione, and improves functioning in most organ systems of the body. The majority of chronic diseases associated with male aging can be significantly helped with DHEA supplementation.</p><p>DHEA use has been shown to be associated with higher levels of energy and well-being, lower obesity and waist-to-hip ratios, enhanced libido and erectile ability, reduced depression, enhanced cognition, reduced death from coronary heart disease, and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> The average dose is 50 mg per day. For men over fifty, this dose will usually raise blood levels of DHEA within two weeks to the same levels they experienced in their early twenties. Some people have taken dosages as high as 1,600 mg per day for extended periods. Side effects even at this high a dosage level are extremely rare.</p><p>When buying DHEA, make sure you are purchasing pharmaceutical-grade DHEA that is at least 98 percent pure. There is animal grade (70 percent pure) and food grade (95 percent pure). DHEA is readily available.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side Effects:</b> Some clinicians feel DHEA can exacerbate the mania stage of manic-depression, others feel it is contraindicated for men whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is high (an indication of prostate disease). The only literature-noted side effect is masculinization (facial hair, etc.) in some women and the case of one woman who developed jaundice and liver problems after one week of use. It is not known if the latter side effect was related to the use of DHEA. Women seem most at risk of side effects.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Zinc</b></p><p class="ctx1">Zinc has significant effects on male sexuality, including sperm motility and production, erections, and even testosterone levels. Because the transformation of androstenedione to testosterone depends on a zinc-dependant enzyme, zinc intake significantly affects testosterone levels in the body. One study found that 60 mg of zinc daily for fifty days increased serum testosterone levels. Because DHT is metabolized from testosterone, a subsequent rise in DHT levels was also seen. Testosterone and DHT levels <i>only</i> increased in those men whose testosterone levels were low. Normal men experienced no increase.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 20 to 40 mg per day for men over forty.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Side effects:</b> Over time, zinc intake can cause copper depletion in the body. To counteract this, most zinc supplements come with copper added. At very high doses, zinc can cause nausea and upset stomach, skin rashes, depression, folate deficiency, and lower tolerance to alcohol.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub><i>(Pantothenic acid)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub> deficiency shows as adrenal atrophy accompanied by fatigue, headache, sleep irregularity, nausea, and abdominal problems. The vitamin is used by the body to keep the adrenal glands healthy and is often low in people suffering from exhausted or overworked adrenals. Men with low levels of androgens often have poorly functioning adrenal glands. Vitamin B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">5</sub> will support healthy adrenal function and the adrenal production of androgens.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> 100 to 500 mg daily.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Androstenedione (Andro)</b></p><p class="ctx1">Androstenedione, often called andro, is one of two androgens in the body that is converted directly into testosterone, making it a metabolic precursor of testosterone. The body converts DHEA to andro and then turns it (usually) into testosterone and (sometimes) into estrone, an estrogen. Andro and testosterone convert back and forth between each other using a specific zinc-dependant enzyme, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Androstenedione is also sometimes made through an entirely different process in the body. Instead of the pathway: pregnenolone <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> 17a-hydroxypregnenolone <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> DHEA <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> andro, it is made: pregnenolone <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> progesterone <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> 17a-hydroxyprogesterone <img alt="image" src="images/img_3.jpg"/> andro. For this second pathway, the enzyme 17,20-lyase is used. Anything that reduces the levels of the particular enzyme (or the zinc it needs) that converts andro to testosterone, or that makes andro in the first place, results in lower levels of testosterone. Licorice, as noted in chapter 7, inhibits the 17,20-lyase enzyme and does reduce both serum testosterone and androstenedione. Interestingly, echinacea <i>(Echinacea purpurea)</i> has been found to <i>increase</i> levels of 17-hydroxysteroids in the body and has shown activity in the kidneys and adrenal glands as a 17-hydroxysteroid stimulant.</p><p>Androstenedione, compared with testosterone, is a weak androgen. Its importance for men is that it has been shown to increase testosterone levels when taken as a supplement. German researchers have found that a 50 mg dose of androstenedione can raise testosterone levels in normal men from 140 to 183 percent above normal. An East German study showed increased testosterone levels of up to 250 percent. However, the peak only lasts a few minutes, and testosterone levels slowly drop to baseline in a few hours. A more recent study by a California urologist found that after taking androstenedione, men experienced a rapid rise in testosterone levels of from 22 to 56 percent within ninety minutes. A placebo-controlled trial in 1997 showed that, compared to placebo, only those taking andro experienced increases of testosterone, about a 24 percent increase on average.</p><p>Men who take andro as a supplement commonly report feelings of increased well-being, energy, and strength. Because it causes a predictable peak in testosterone levels, some men take it ninety minutes prior to sex to stimulate sexual arousal and response or prior to exercise to get maximum effect from a workout.</p><p>Testosterone tends to peak in the body in midmorning, midafternoon, and between three and five a.m. As men age, the height of these peaks lowers, sometimes considerably and especially in those who are testosterone compromised. Some people have recommended that andro be taken upon rising, again at noon, and again before bed to simulate the body’s normal patterns.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Between 50 and 100 mg three times per day. Some people preferred to allow the pill to dissolve under the tongue so that it entered the bloodstream directly instead of going through the liver and digestive system. Some research has indicated this was more effective. The androstenedione in pine pollen does in fact enter the blood directly when taken as a tincture. <b>Note:</b> Androstenedione as an individual supple-ment is no longer legal. After the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act in 2005, it has been considered a controlled substance, despite the fact that since 1996 an estimated fifty million doses of androstenedione have been taken with no reported side effects.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</b></p><p class="ctx1">There is a growing controversy about DHT, its presence in the male body, and what it does as men age. There is considerable controversy about whether it should be used as a supplement, even with a prescription.</p><p>DHT is made from testosterone through the action of two enzymes—Type I and Type II 5-alpha reductase. DHT is, in fact, much more powerful than testosterone. It binds ten times more powerfully to the body’s androgen receptors, it cannot be metabolized into estrogens (as can testosterone), and it inhibits the action of aromatase (the enzyme that converts testosterone to estradiol). DHT seems to act strongly to regulate the androgen/estrogen balance in the body. The controversy over DHT arises because a number of people believe that it is responsible for the current epidemic of prostate problems in men in the United States. As a result, many people strongly advise that men not use DHT supplementation and heavily support the use of pharmaceuticals that interfere with the action of 5-alpha reductase to decrease DHT levels in the body. There is growing evidence that these perspectives about DHT are incorrect.</p><p>Some physicians, such as the French endocrinologist Bruno de Lignieres, have suggested that the best treatment for an inflamed prostate may, in fact, be DHT. His research has indicated that prostate problems may be occurring not from the presence of DHT but from an imbalance in the androgen/estrogen ratio. A growing body of research indicates that estradiol levels are indeed a more likely initiator of prostate inflammation than DHT. Because DHT is not convertible to estradiol through the action of aromatase, it could in fact help relieve prostate inflammation if this is correct. For more on this, see the section in chapter 8 on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis. A number of studies with DHT have borne this out. Research has shown <i>no</i> correlation between DHT use and prostate enlargement in older men. Estradiol, but not DHT, has been found to act with SHBG to cause an eightfold increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, a substance that increases cellular activity) in human BPH tissue, which causes increased growth of the prostate. Because DHT blocks binding of estradiol to SHBG, its presence completely negates the effects of estradiol. In fact, the use of DHT in clinical trials was found to lower levels of both estradiol and SHBG.</p><p>Clinical trials have also shown that during supplemental administration of DHT, men did not experience prostate enlargement and levels of serum PSA (prostate specific antigen—an indicator for prostate disease) did not increase, while urine stream strength did increase, showing that the prostate was shrinking. In other words, there <i>was</i> relief in the obstructive symptoms experienced by the patients who had BPH, not an increase, as there would be if DHT were the cause of prostate enlargement.</p><p>In human trials and clinical use, DHT has been found to increase androgen levels, aid feelings of well-being, counter many of the effects of low testosterone levels, and support better erections and libido. DHT topical gel containing 70 mg of DHT was found safe and effective when used in a three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with thirty-three men over age sixty; all had low testosterone levels. The men experienced improved blood cholesterol levels, decreases in fat mass, and increases in muscle strength. The report notes that <i>“standard markers of prostate or cardiovascular diseases were not adversely affected by the DHT treatment”</i> (emphasis mine).</p><p>DHT is exceptionally important in the health of the body and there are growing reports that the widespread use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors is having mild negative effects on muscle mass and even stronger negative impacts on normal male androgenization. DHT is in many ways the most important hormone in the development of male characteristics, not testosterone. Men who are born lacking the 5-alpha reductase enzyme develop little or no pubic hair, have an underdeveloped prostate and penis, and experience disrupted libido and sexual capacity. Weight lifters who take testosterone with 5-alpha reductase blockers have experienced reduced muscle enhancement in their muscle-building programs instead of more. DHT, it turns out, is crucial for the central nervous system and brain. It is vital in the organization and functioning of neural cells in the brain and has a greater neural impact than testosterone. Both testosterone and DHT increase the proliferation of androgen receptors in neural cells. However, testosterone’s effects begin to fade after three hours, yet DHT maintains the increase for up to twenty-four hours. The brain converts the testosterone to estrogens when it needs estradiol to maintain healthy brain function, but it also converts testosterone to DHT through the use of 5-alpha reductase. The use of 5-alpha reductase blockers may, in fact, produce negative impacts on brain function because they are generic in their action, not specific to the prostate. DHT is also made in a number of peripheral target cells to carry out essential functions of the body. By blocking the action of 5-alpha reductase, pharmaceutical blockers prevent the brain and all other peripheral tissues from converting testosterone to DHT when they need it.</p><p>These new findings about DHT in the brain suggest that, as in the prostate, it is the correct balance of androgens to estrogen that create the healthiest functioning. Research has also begun to suggest that DHT and testosterone affect the body and specifically the prostate through very different mechanisms. Testosterone alone may be insufficient in keeping the body healthy, DHT is proving essential. In the rush to blame DHT as the culprit for an enlarged prostate, its general impacts on male health are being overlooked.</p><p class="ctx4"><b>Suggested Dosage:</b> Nearly the only place that DHT is available is in France where it is usually prescribed as a topical gel containing 70 mg.</p><p>Because of the controversy about DHT, you should educate yourself and decide whether you want to use it or not based on all available information. Bearing the controversy in mind, DHT is felt by many people to be contraindicated for men with prostatitis, BPH, and prostate cancer. It is definitely NOT for adolescent males, as it will interfere with normal hormonal development.</p></div></body></html>
