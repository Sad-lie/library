It is in men as in soils, where sometimes there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of.</i></p><p class="ceps">J<small>ONATHAN</small> S<small>WIFT</small></p><p class="ctxtop">There are essentially four kinds of hormones in our bodies, and they are typed depending on what kind of molecule they are built from. Sexual hormones such as testosterone are built around a specific type of molecule, a sterol, from which the word <i>steroid</i> comes. You are familiar with the name of the particular sterol that is used for sexual hormones—cholesterol. It is, in fact, cholesterol from which all steroid hormones are made.</p><p>Adrenaline is another kind of hormone that serves as a source of energy during the flight-or-fight response. It is built around an amino acid called tyrosine (as is the thyroid hormone thyroxine) in the adrenal gland. Another type of hormone, insulin, which is highly important in the body’s ability to utilize glucose (a kind of sugar) effectively, is built in the pancreas using complex proteins. Others are built around short-chain amino acids called peptides.</p><p>Hormones regulate much of the functioning of our bodies. Through complex biofeedback loops, our bodies determine exactly what their needs are at any one moment in time and either make or release hormones to shift their functioning in the direction it needs to go. As an example of this kind of generalized biofeedback, there is no central thermostat in our bodies that keeps them at a certain temperature. Despite the famous 98.6° redlined on so many thermometers, the temperature of the body shifts constantly; it is always in flux. The various systems of the body compare notes as it were and together, in some manner not understood by scientists, come to a conclusion about how temperature needs to shift and then shift it. We are more a collection of cooperating parts, each with its own innate intelligence, than a mechanical system with the brain acting as intelligent overseer. Our hormone levels are, as well, constantly in flux. Our bodies make and release hormones as we need them to remain vital and healthy. Part of this process includes the making and releasing of sexual hormones. In middle age, the amount of testosterone in male bodies naturally shifts, as does the balance between androgens and estrogens. It is the movement toward excess levels of estrogen and the overreduction of testosterone that produces a great many of the problems that men face as they age.</p><div id="c02s01.01"><p class="csht">T<small>HE</small> <small>SEXUAL</small> H<small>ORMONES</small></p><p class="ctx1">Women’s sexual hormones are collectively known as estrogens, the main ones being estradiol, estrone, estriol, and 16<i>a</i>-hydroxyestrone. Estradiol is the most pervasive and the strongest in its effects, much like testosterone in males. Progesterone, not usually considered an estrogen, is another female steroid hormone that most people have heard of.</p><p>Men’s sexual hormones are collectively known as androgens, the primary ones being testosterone, androstenedione (andro), androstenediol, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), a slightly more complex form of DHEA.</p><p>The precursor to all these hormones is cholesterol, which is converted, in sequence, into the steroid hormones pregnenolone and 17<i>a</i>-hydroxypregnenolone. Essentially, pregnenolone is the primary steroid hormone that is converted, or metabolized, into all the other steroid hormones in both women and men; for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as a prohormone. Other people sometimes refer to it as the “mother” steroid, which I guess would make cholesterol the “grandmother.” All women have some androgens, all men have some estrogens. Each is important in the healthy functioning of our bodies.</p><p>In women, estrogens are made in the ovaries, adrenal glands (which sit on top of the kidneys), and brain. Increasingly, research is revealing that both androgens and estrogens also act as potent neurohormones that strongly affect central nervous system activity, which is why both estrogens and androgens are produced in the brain and central nervous system.</p><p>Androgens are made in men’s testicles, adrenal glands, brain, and peripheral tissues and cells—that is, any muscle tissue or any other cell or organ in the body that needs androgens for a particular function at a specific time. About 95 percent of testosterone is made in a man’s testes, most of the rest is made in the adrenal glands, and a small amount is made in peripheral tissues and cells. Other androgens (such as DHEA and DHEAS) are made in the brain from precursors or prohormones like pregnenolone. The two sexual hormones that seem to be the most important, at least on the surface, are estradiol in women and testosterone in men.</p><p>Everyone knows that testosterone makes a man a man. Its presence in our bodies literally does make us men. Testosterone peaks three times in our lives. During the second trimester of fetal development, blood levels of testosterone increase from nearly zero to about 4.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). (A nanogram is a billionth of a gram, and a milliliter is 0.034 of an ounce.) This is a tremendously tiny amount, yet it causes the fetus to develop as male. Then after birth, testosterone begins to rise again, peaks around six months of age at about 2.5 ng/mL, and drops slowly back to near zero by age one. Part of the purpose of this surge in testosterone after birth is to initiate the formation of the prostate gland. Still, the gland remains tiny, weighing only 1 to 2 grams. The final rise in testosterone begins between ages ten and eleven and rises slowly to a peak of about 5.0 ng/mL around the age of eighteen. Then it holds relatively steady until sometime around the age of forty-five, when it very slowly declines throughout the rest of life. During this last rise of testosterone in adolescence, the penis, scrotum, and prostate gland all enlarge, the voice deepens, facial and body hair begins to grow, sperm production begins, the bones lengthen and grow more massive, and the body expands rapidly to a much larger size.</p><p>Because the overall testosterone levels in the body that physicians usually test for (as opposed to free testosterone, which is something I will talk about later) remain roughly the same after age forty-five, because men can still father children after that age, and because there is not a sudden, comparable, shift in body functions similar to that which women experience during the cessation of menstruation, many physicians and researchers have insisted that there is no such thing as a male menopause and that, in spite of so many men experiencing it, it is all in our heads. Other researchers, who do not accept this perspective, however, have found two interesting things. The first is that while the overall levels of total testosterone remain relatively constant, <i>free</i> testosterone levels do change considerably. The second is that the androgen/estrogen ratio shifts significantly as well.</p><p>Of the testosterone in the male body, 70 to 80 percent is bound to a protein—sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Another 20 percent or so is bound to a different protein—albumin. Bound testosterone is used up, not available, doing something else. Only free testosterone, which makes up 1 to 3 percent of the body’s total testosterone level, is completely biologically available and active at the receptor sites of testosterone target cells. As we age, the amounts of these testosterone types alter considerably, which contributes to the alterations men experience in middle age. SHBG bound testosterone increases nearly 80 percent by age ninety. By age 100, free testosterone will usually disappear entirely. The Massachusetts Male Aging Study, conducted at the New England Research Institute in Watertown, MA, found that, in general, in healthy men the amount of free testosterone declines an average of 1.2 percent per year between the ages of thirty-nine and seventy.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr2"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt2">1</a></sup> During this same period, albumin-bound testosterone declines around 1.0 percent per year, while SHBG-bound testosterone and body levels of SHBG increase 1.2 percent per year. But, bound testosterone is only part of the story. During the same time period, the quantity of testosterone that is converted to other substances increases as well.</p><p>Testosterone itself is not an end product. It gets converted into other substances that the body needs. For instance, an enzyme called aromatase converts testosterone to the estrogen estradiol, and another enzyme, 5-alpha reductase, converts testosterone to DHT, which many people consider the most potent androgenic substance of all (and the actual hormone that does what testosterone has long been thought to do). DHT is a potent androgen, while estradiol is a potent estrogen. In many respects, estradiol can be considered the substance that makes women women. So, the substance that testosterone is converted into (DHT or estradiol) has tremendous impacts on male health and well-being.</p><p>In small amounts, estradiol in men is crucial in supporting the health and growth of the neural filaments in the brain, which connect brain cells to each other. Estradiol is also crucial in the creation and maintenance of the essential brain neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Estradiol and other estrogens in the male body also support healthy sexual functioning, blood and arterial flow, skin health, and so on. During the middle-age shift, male bodies naturally begin to have a bit more estradiol than they did when younger. This contributes to some of the changes we experience. But, if too much testosterone is converted to estradiol, the androgen/estrogen balance is significantly altered and this can have tremendous impacts on how we feel as men. It can affect our levels of health as well.</p><p>The increasing loss of free testosterone over time creates significant alterations in our bodies and our experiences of ourselves. (Remember, we are male simply from exposure to tiny nanogram quantities of testosterone while we were in the womb.) And, at the same time, we are experiencing <i>more</i> estrogenic hormones which, at the same tiny nanogram levels, make women who they are. It is no wonder that so many men’s experience of themselves and their lives change so much as they begin entering their forties and fifties.</p><p>It is this shift in free testosterone levels and the changing androgen/estrogen ratio together that signals our movement into middle age. Hormonal shifting as we move into new stages of life is something that our bodies naturally do, much as when, as infants in the womb, we released the chemicals that began our mother’s contractions leading to our birth. These hormonal shifts occur at different ages for every man and no one can predict why, how, or when they will naturally occur. It is an expression of our unique selves: genetic history, body chemistry, environment, beliefs, stresses, foods, hopes, dreams, aspirations, losses, grievings, loves, and destiny. It is a natural occurrence, not an inevitable <i>decline,</i> not a disease. It simply is a shift into a new way of being, a new expression of maleness.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is where environmental pollutants become a problem. Industrial substances in the millions of tons are entering the environment each year and having tremendous impacts on male sexual health. They are exacerbating the movement into middle age that men naturally experience. Researchers have found that some of these substances cause more testosterone to be converted to estradiol, others actually interfere with the production of testosterone, and still others are potent estrogens that, as they are taken into our bodies, seriously disrupt the androgen/estrogen balance. For many of us, androgen levels are so profoundly affected that sexual vitality and quality of life are significantly reduced.</p></div></div></body></html>
