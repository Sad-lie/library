If you are having trouble with your levels of testosterone or your androgen/estrogen ratio, you should especially avoid consuming any quantity of licorice, black cohosh, and hops. Each of these plants contains substances that are either potent estrogens, act as androgen antagonists, or interfere with the conversion of prohormones into androgens, or stimulate the conversion of androgens into estrogens.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Licorice <i>(Glycyrrhiza glabra)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">Licorice is an exceptionally good herb for a great many things, however, it should be used sparingly, if at all, and only for conditions for which nothing else will do. Licorice has highly negative effects on men’s androgen levels and hormonal functioning. In numerous human studies, for example, it has been found to inhibit the actions of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which is used to convert cortisol to cortisone and back again as each compound is needed. Cortisol is highly active in the body, and a specific ratio is naturally maintained between cortisol and cortisone in order to minimize the negative effects of cortisol. (Natural cortisone is structurally different than pharmaceutical cortisone preparations. The body converts both types of cortisone to cortisol to make them active.) By inhibiting 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, licorice upsets the cortisol/cortisone ratio. Any imbalance in this ratio will usually have strongly negative side effects.</p><p>High cortisol levels have been linked to impaired immune health, reduced ability to utilize glucose in the blood, increased bone loss, osteoporosis, increased fat accumulation around the hips and waist, impaired memory and learning, destruction of brain cells, and impaired skin growth and regeneration. Cortisol levels sometimes rise in the bodies of weight lifters who are training intensively. In such cases, it will cause the breakdown of muscle tissue because cortisol converts proteins in the muscles into glucose as a source of energy. High cortisol levels also cause a lowering of testosterone levels in the body; basically, cortisol appears to suppress testosterone. Part of the reason for this is that the steroid hormone pregnenolone is converted to cortisol through enzymatic activity. If it is not converted to cortisol, pregnenolone is instead turned into testosterone and other DHEA-based androgens. The shifting of the body to cortisol production tends to lower DHEA production and, as a result, testosterone levels.</p><p>In addition, licorice actually restricts the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone into the androgen androstenedione (which itself becomes testosterone and DHT) by inhibiting the 17,20-lyase enzyme. Clinical studies have found that the use of licorice by men decreases levels of both serum testosterone and androstenedione while raising levels of progesterone. This directly results in decreased libido and various forms of sexual dysfunction. To compound this dynamic, licorice also contains at least seven estrogenic compounds. Two of them are direct estrogens (rather than estrogen mimics): clycestrone and estriol. Clycestrone is similar to estrone but is only 1/533 as potent. Estriol is (as is estrogen) one of the three primary estrogenic steroids produced in the body. Usually, high levels of estriol are present only in women during pregnancy.</p><p>To sum up, licorice intake increases cortisol levels in the body, lowers the production of testosterone, and directly increases levels of estrogens. It also possesses a number of other, sometimes serious, side effects from continued use or the use of high levels of the extracts.</p><p>Because of these cumulative impacts, men who are concerned about the androgen/estrogen ratio in their bodies should not use licorice except short term for specific conditions such as stomach ulcers. Although most people do not know it, licorice is used with some frequency in dark beers to increase head, as a coloring agent, and to sweeten the end product (see Hops listing below).</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Black Cohosh <i>(Cimicifuga racesmosa)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">Black cohosh is highly estrogenic and is often used for normalizing female hormonal levels during menopause and to alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. It has shown an antagonist activity toward the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is essential in testosterone production. It is sometimes used by men for muscle pain as it is an exceptionally good antispasmodic. It should be avoided by men with androgenic imbalances unless no other herb will do.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Hops <i>(Humulus lupulus)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">Hops is best known for its use in beer. The majority of physicians and men overlook its potent chemicals and do not realize that beer itself can significantly alter male androgen levels. German beer makers noticed long ago that the young women who picked hops in the fields commonly experienced early menstrual periods. Eventually, researchers discovered the reason—hops is perhaps one of the most powerfully estrogenic plants on Earth. Just 100 g of hops (about 3.5 oz) contains anywhere from 30,000 to 300,000 IUs of estrogens, depending on the type of hops. Most of it is the very potent estrogen estradiol. Estradiol, as it is taken into the male body, causes a direct lowering of testosterone levels in the testes and an increase in SHBG levels, which then binds up even more free testosterone in the bloodstream. The estradiol in hops has also been found to directly interfere with the ability of the testes Leydig cells to produce testosterone. The presence of this highly estrogenic substance in beer is not an accident.</p><p>Prior to the German Beer Purity Act of 1516, beer almost never contained hops. In fact, more than one hundred different plants were used in brewing beer for at least ten thousand years prior to the introduction of hops in the middle ages. For the last thousand years of that period, the most dominant form of “beer” was called gruit, which contained a mixture of yarrow, bog myrtle, and marsh rosemary. These herbs, especially in beer, are sexually and mentally stimulating. (It is rare to become sleepy when drinking un-hopped beers.) The Catholic Church had a monopoly on the production of gruit, but competing merchants and the Protestants worked together to break that monopoly and force the removal of all sexually stimulating herbs from beer. They replaced them with an herb that puts the drinker to sleep and dulls sexual drive in the male. The legislative arguments of the day all hinged on the issue of the stimulating effects of other herbs that were used in beer. A pilsner, for example, was originally a henbane beer (<i>pilsen</i> means “henbane”), which is an incredibly strong, psychoactive beer, used earlier in history by German berserkers before battle. The German Beer Purity Act was, in effect, the first drug control law ever enacted.</p><p>Beer, so highly touted as sexy in television commercials, in actuality can powerfully inhibit sexual strength in men. There is a well-known condition in England—Brewer’s Droop—that occurs from middle-aged brewers’ extensive handling of hops plants. The plant chemistries readily transmit through the men’s skin just as they did in the young women in the fields. Very few physicians have looked at any correlation between beer drinking and androgen levels or erectile dysfunction problems in their patients. (How many men on Viagra are heavy beer drinkers?) However, the physician Eugene Shippen in <i>The Testosterone Syndrome</i> comments that one of his patients, undergoing pharmaceutical testosterone replacement therapy, showed no response to the testosterone <i>until he reduced his beer intake to one to two beers a night from six to seven</i>.<sup xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops"><a id="nr25"/><a href="9781620555057_nts.htm#nt25">1</a></sup> Hops is extremely potent and <i>its consumption should be limited if not completely</i> <i>excluded during all androgen replacement therapy</i>. These effects can be exacerbated if the beers you buy also contain licorice (see Licorice section at beginning of chapter), a fact that will not be noted on the beer label.</p><p>It is possible to buy beer that does not interfere with androgen levels, although it can be somewhat hard to find. Some microbreweries and brew pubs are now making traditional gruits. Check the brew pubs in your town. However, the best source is Bruce Williams, a Scottish brewer who is bringing back the traditional ales of Europe and especially Scotland (i.e., pre-hopped European beers). He has five in production, and they can often be found in larger American cities at any store that carries a wide selection of unusual beers. The heather ale is excellent but perhaps more useful would be the traditional pine ale made from the Scotch pine, <i>Pinus sylvestris,</i> whose pollen contains testosterone.</p><p>It is also best to buy beers that are bottle-conditioned. Bottle-conditioned beers are carbonated in the bottle and as such contain live yeasts. These yeasts (most commonly <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) are highly nutritive. They are extremely high in protein, glucose tolerance factor, and B vitamins—especially niacin and B<sub xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops">1</sub>. Glucose tolerance factor, because it helps regulate blood sugar levels, can help with many of the problems associated with diabetes. Brewer’s yeast contains the highest levels of glucose tolerance factor of any food. It has also been found to reduce serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and newer research has indicated that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> yeasts may have direct enhancement impacts on androgen activity in the body.</p><p><i>And since I am on the subject . . .</i></p><div id="c07s01.01"><p class="csht">A<small>LCOHOL AND</small> M<small>ALE</small> H<small>EALTH</small></p><p class="ctx1">The United States is undergoing one of its periodic bouts of puritanitis (a spasming or inflammation of the Puritan Reflex). In spite of this, alcohol has been with the human species a long time. It is a <i>naturally</i> occurring substance, found throughout nature, and many living organisms are known to imbibe—the birds <i>and</i> the bees. Life, in fact, could not exist without the fermentation that both bacteria and yeasts provide. Nearly all indigenous cultures on Earth ferment and have done so for between ten thousand and thirty thousand years. Beer anthropologists (yes, they exist) have found significant evidence that the Egyptians settled where they did and developed agriculture and cities because they discovered that the naturally growing grain in that region could be fermented. In other words, civilization began when we started <i>drinking,</i> not when we starting thinking.</p><p>Alcohol is exceptionally good for the body <i>in moderation</i>. It stimulates the functioning of most organs, especially the liver and brain, to more optimum levels of health. However, in large quantities, alcohol’s well-known negative effects come into play. Overuse leads to highly adverse effects on, not surprisingly, the liver and brain; basically, a case of overstimulation. Still, it is important to note that alcohol consumption significantly increases the metabolic conversion of androgenic precursors to more potent androgens (basically DHEA to androstenediol). Moderate alcohol consumption has also been found to increase the production of androgens by the adrenal glands and to promote healthy androgen levels in the body. However, ingesting large quantities of alcohol can exhaust the body’s androgen levels and even interfere with their production. In rats, high alcohol intake over short time spans causes the leeching of all DHEA from the brain. While in humans, sustained high levels of alcohol have been found to reduce levels of testosterone and other androgens. Consistently high levels of alcohol cause the accumulation of tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids, which inhibit production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the testes. Tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids have been found to be as potent in that respect as the female hormone estradiol. They also interfere with the liver’s ability to remove estrogen from the body by interfering with the liver’s cytochrome P-450 system (the part of the liver concerned with estrogen removal).</p><p><i>Naturally occurring fermentations have been shown to be much healthier for the human body</i>—that is, wines and bottle-conditioned beers, especially beers that do not contain hops. Most studies have shown that one to two drinks of alcohol per day are associated with higher levels of health. More than that and the level of health may begin to decline. Grapes also possess anti-aromatase activity (helping in preventing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol) and antioxidant properties (keeping cellular vitality high). Red wines also contain polyphenols, which are exceptionally good at regulating the impacts of fat on the health of the body. Alcohol content is normally limited to around 12 percent in nature—levels higher than that kill the yeast. It is primarily when alcohol content is concentrated beyond that level (as with distilled drinks), when the yeasts are removed (they counteract many of the side effects of alcohol ingestion, such as the loss of B vitamins), or when it is consumed to excess (as we do with sugar or fat) that side effects begin to be seen.</p><p class="ctx4sl"><b>Grapefruit <i>(Citrus paradisi)</i></b></p><p class="ctx1">I am pleased to finally find a good reason for my long dislike of grapefruit. Through a number of avenues (especially impacts on the cytochrome P450 system that breaks down estrogens in the liver), grapefruit interferes with the removal of estrogens from the body, increasing overall estrogen levels. It should be avoided by men following an androgen enhancement protocol . . . well, probably by all men.</p></div><div id="c07s01.02"><p class="csht">O<small>THER</small> T<small>HINGS TO</small> A<small>VOID</small></p><p class="ctx1">There are a number of substances that interfere with the removal of estrogen from the male body.
