Harary was good enough that during the Iran hostage crisis that year, Jake Stewart at the National Security Council decided to task him with a special, <a id="filepos583755"></a>high-priority target. Harary seemed to be particularly good at remote-viewing people, and in this case, the NSC was interested in an American hostage named Richard Queen, who was believed to be suffering from the early stages of multiple sclerosis. Stewart and the NSC wanted to know how he was bearing up.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Stewart told Puthoff only that he had a “target personality” he wanted remote-viewed. In other words, no one even at SRI knew what the target was. Monitored by Targ, Harary sat down at the table in the RV room for a series of sessions one afternoon. His style was more like extended <a id="filepos584439"></a>remote viewing (ERV) than Ingo’s CRV. He sat back quietly in his chair, very relaxed, often with his eyes closed, mostly verbalizing his impressions rather than sketching them. He described a thin, bearded man in spartan, cold surroundings. The man had health problems, including severe nausea and nerve damage that had nearly immobilized one side of his body. There were people around the man, and Harary described them too. The remote viewer also sensed that his target was about to travel; it seemed that he would be on an airplane within two or three days.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After the session was over and the results had been sent back to Stewart at the NSC, Harary discussed his results with Puthoff and Targ. They suspected that the target had been some head of state—but who?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Back at the NSC, Stewart was impressed by Harary’s data. The description seemed clearly to be that of Richard Queen. The prediction about the airplane was puzzling, however. Were the Iranians up to something? Were they about to release Queen? The NSC began to prepare for that eventuality, and two days later the Iranians, evidently not wanting Queen to die in their custody, put him on a plane home. A U.S. medical team confirmed the things that Harary had said about his declining health. Later, Queen himself was debriefed, and some of Harary’s data were read to him, without mention of the source. Queen became angry, concluding that one of his Iranian captors must have been an American spy all along—for how else could U.S. officials have known about his experiences in such detail?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Harary, still only in his late twenties, was the youngest remote viewer at SRI. Not very tall, he had dark, curly hair, a beard and a mustache, and an exotic bloodline that came from the small community of Jews in Egypt—though Harary himself was born on Long Island.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A series of intense out-of-body experiences in his teenage years had brought him to the American Society for Psychical Research in New York, where for a time he had <a></a>worked alongside Ingo Swann. Swann and others knew Harary then as “Blue”—a nickname that Keith’s friends had given him in childhood, and which he kept until the early 1980s.<a id="filepos586973" href="#filepos604469">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Later, as an undergraduate psychology major at Duke University, Harary sat for experiments with psi researchers at the school’s electrical engineering department. One of these experiments is now legendary. Harary, accompanied by a researcher who monitored his condition, lay down on a bed in one building, and at a randomly selected time, was asked to enter a trance and have an out-of-body experience. When he reached that state, he tried to move his out-of-body self to a special room in another building. In that special room, arranged with a checkerboard pattern of black-and-white floor tiles, sat Harary’s cat, “Spirit.” Video monitors recorded Spirit’s movements and noises, which seemed ordinary—until Harary, his physical self lying on a bed hundreds of yards away, reached his OBE state. At that point the cat became significantly calmer,<a id="filepos588012"></a>† as if staring at something. When Harary came out of his trance, the cat went back to normal. The experiment had been almost spookily successful, although for some reason Harary and the Duke researchers had never really been able to repeat it. In any case, Harary’s renown was such that after meeting Puthoff in late 1979, the young psychic had been invited to join the team at SRI.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Harary was an articulate and intelligent young man, with an intense, almost lawyerly love for precision and logic. He had some definite opinions about psi and remote viewing, and preferred to be thought of as a researcher or a consultant; he came to detest the label <em class="calibre4">psychic</em>. He was therefore in many ways like Ingo Swann. Unsurprisingly, given their strong personalities, the two didn’t get along very well.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Harary found Swann’s professorial posture the hardest to take. The young remote viewer felt that he was about as good as, and perhaps in some senses better than, the older fellow teaching him. He was comfortable enough with his own remote-viewing insights and methods, and was far from being convinced that Swann’s new multi-stage scheme was the one true technique that suited everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To be convinced of such an argument, Harary reasoned, he would have to see some well-controlled studies comparing, say, remote viewers using Ingo’s technique with the same remote viewers using their own varied techniques. He didn’t see any serious efforts being made to gather such data.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Moreover, Harary believed that many of Swann’s insights weren’t original, having been made already by René Warcollier and Upton Sinclair. And those insights, he felt, could have been packaged into a remote-viewing scheme in any number of ways. To Harary, Swann didn’t have a magic formula; he merely had strong opinions, and a certain protectiveness about anything he had invented himself.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A classic example of this protectiveness, as Harary saw it, was Swann’s insistence on using geographical coordinates. It seemed that Swann liked coordinates because they were his idea, and he had charmed Jack Vorona and his contract monitor, Jim Salyer, and the money was flowing, and no one really thought to question it anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But as far as Harary could tell, the use of coordinates only seemed to hurt the overall technique. When Harary heard a set of coordinates at the start of a session, his mind couldn’t help trying to calculate where the target was. If the coordinates were something like 5° S, 30° E, Aol images of humid African jungle would immediately start to flash into <a id="filepos591112"></a>his mind, though the target might be something significantly different. Geographical coordinates, Harary believed, were a tragic flaw in the procedure. Even when they seemed to work, they made remote viewing look bad.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At times, Puthoff seemed sympathetic to this view. Still, he didn’t protest when the DIA sent funds for Swann’s coordinate remote-viewing contract. In his ever-cautious, low-key manner, Puthoff merely suggested that alternative targeting methods should continue to be explored alongside coordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But to Harary, the work at SRI already had provided evidence to suggest that alternative techniques worked just as well. There were all the experiments SRI had done without coordinates, such as outbound remote viewing, and remote viewing of objects in boxes and in canisters and on microdots. Eventually they tried putting objects in a matrix of cubbyholes, the matrix columns lettered A–G and the rows numbered 1–7. Thus, instead of a geographical coordinate scheme, there was a very basic letter/number coordinate scheme. Puthoff would sit down at the RV table and say, “B-seven,” and Harary, or Hammid, or whoever was the viewer, would try to describe what he or she saw there. There was no obvious difference in accuracy between these tests and Swann’s CRV scheme.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Nor did remote-viewing accuracy seem to suffer when Puthoff scrambled the geographical coordinates of the target with an encryption algorithm, and gave them to the viewer. Nor did accuracy suffer when Puthoff gave encrypted coordinates to viewers who <em class="calibre4">didn’t even know</em> that the coordinates were encrypted; in other words, the numbers they had were random as far as they knew. Finally, one day, Puthoff was in the remote-viewing room with Harary, about to start a session, and Harary in exasperation said, “<a id="filepos593200"></a>Why don’t you just say ‘target’?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Okay,” said Puthoff. “Target.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Both remember that Harary nailed the site.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><a></a><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2">The <a id="filepos593689"></a>infighting at SRI in those days may not have been extraordinary for a program of that size, but to some it did seem dismayingly unique. There were conflicts over space, over lab resources, over contract money, over research methods, and sometimes over nothing more than personality differences. Anyone expecting an enlightened environment of researchers pulling together, to advance the beleaguered cause of psi, would have been quickly brought down to earth after a brief exposure to the internal politics of SRF’s remote-viewing lab.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There was, just for example, the clash between Hella Hammid and Keith Harary. In Harary’s opinion, Hammid had begun to see herself as some kind of superpsychic or demi-goddess. The day after Harary and his wife Darlene were married, Hammid solemnly told the newlyweds that she had had an unfortunate psychic impression: Their marriage would never work. “Don’t feel bad,” she commiserated, “it will be a learning experience.” (At the time of writing, fourteen years later, their marriage is still intact.)</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The turf battles within SRI were much worse. There were battles between the DIA’s Jim Salyer and SRI researchers, and there were battles between the researchers and consultants like Swann. Swann effectively oversaw a substantial part of the program, and perhaps understandably, guarded his domain with vigilance. As he would later paint the scene, his day-to-day work at SRI was a never-ending battle against encroachments by others in the program. Swann would later remember one episode in which, allegedly, he chased Targ and Puthoff out of some room at SRI—a room they had been trying to take over for another project—ran after them down a hall, and threw a hammer at them as they entered an elevator.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ed May was a physicist who had been brought into the program in 1976. Short, bearded, a bit breathless, he struggled to set up his own contractual fiefdoms at SRI. In trying <a id="filepos595903"></a>to get funding for one of his projects, he ran afoul of Swann, and the two men fell out. Swann would later say, “I regret to this day that I didn’t look at Ed May’s horoscope first.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Hal Puthoff stood in the middle, trying to exert a calming influence, trying to keep all these centrifugal forces from flinging the SRI program apart. For a while he succeeded. But then, finally, everything seemed to come loose. Sometime in 1982 Harary and Hammid began to press for their own project, which would be run by Targ and kept separate from Swann’s project. They didn’t want to work with Swann anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Targ supported the idea. Memoranda were written. One, pro Harary and Hammid and contra Swann, was written by Gary Langford. Swann consequently demanded that all three remote viewers be expelled from his domain. Puthoff and Targ and Jim Salyer argued with Swann over this, but when the dust had cleared, Harary and Hammid were gone from SRI, and Langford, though he would stay on at the lab, was gone from Swann’s project. Swann stood atop the rubble, triumphant again.<a id="filepos597167" href="#filepos605005">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Next to go was Targ, but this time Swann had little to do with it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As of 1982, Targ was one of the four or five best-known figures in parapsychology, not just in America but in the world. Yet Targ had been busy making enemies within Grill Flame, and Swann wasn’t the only one.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">During 1981 and early 1982 Targ was supposed to have been working on a study comparing different RV prompting techniques, including geographical coordinates, encrypted coordinates, the word “target,” and the outbound <a id="filepos597951"></a>remote-viewing protocol. When he finished his report, early in the spring of 1982, he put it on Salyer’s desk.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Hal Puthoff had been away in China on a research trip. When he returned, he had a crisis on his hands. Salyer and other DIA officials had complained loudly that Targ’s targeting studies report had been very sloppy, with problems ranging from faulty statistics to incorrect captions on graphs and photos. The DIA was now talking about kicking Targ off the project. Puthoff and Ed May spent some time correcting the report, and Puthoff sent Targ a stern memorandum, concluding ominously that the study’s flaws “can lead people who assess your work to feel that there are legitimate reasons to question your professional competence as a Senior Research Physicist.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Targ promised to do better next time. But there would not be a next time. The DIA soon announced that Targ’s salary would no longer be paid through Grill Flame funds.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In accordance with SRI rules for employees who suddenly are left without outside sponsorship, Targ was given a small office, and his salary was paid out of SRI’s “overhead” account. But the clock was ticking. He had eight months in which to find an outside contract or to graft himself onto an ongoing SRI project. He didn’t even try, and after the eight months had passed, in early 1983, Targ left SRI for good.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">He let it be known that he had departed for high moral reasons. He had been sorely dismayed—shocked, <em class="calibre4">shocked</em>, he might have said—by the emphasis on military applications of remote viewing. Since SRI had not publicized the real reasons for Targ’s ouster, this alternative explanation managed to survive without serious challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For a while Targ teamed up with Keith Harary, and went for a tour of the Soviet Union. The two travelled to Bratislava, Moscow, Leningrad, Yerevan, meeting with psi researchers, giving lectures, swapping stories. The prospect of <a id="filepos600328"></a>Soviet intelligence officers getting their hands on Targ, who knew some of the most intimate details of one of the Pentagon’s most sensitive programs, naturally raised concerns at SRI and the DIA. As one member of the program said later, “We had a very tight policy at SRI about not talking about sponsorship, not talking about details of experiments, unless given specific permission by the sponsor. In general, Russell seemed to have a little less regard for those constraints than everyone else. And once he was completely away from SRI, he probably felt constrained even less. It was always something to think about.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the end of 1984 Targ had made three visits to the Soviet Union, and claimed to be working with remote-viewing researchers at the Institute of Theoretical Problems in Moscow. “We’re looking for the physical correlates that relate psychic functioning to the rest of physics,” he told the British magazine <em class="calibre4">New Scientist</em>, insisting that the work was pure science, far removed from military applications.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Back in California, in fact before Targ officially left SRI, he and Harary and a businessman named Tony White founded a company called <a id="filepos601691"></a>Delphi Associates. Their first venture involved an ESP game that they tried to sell to the computer game maker Atari. Unfortunately Atari itself folded before anything substantial came of the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Delphi’s second venture involved the use of associative remote viewing to play the silver futures market. It worked like this: On a Sunday afternoon, for example, from a pool of several dozen Bay Area target sites, Targ would select two. One—say, the dramatic Transamerica skyscraper in San Francisco—would signify “market up on Monday.” The other—say, Fisherman’s Wharf—would signify “market down on Monday.” Harary would not know about either of these sites. He would simply be asked to remote-view, precognitively, the site to which Targ would take him the following afternoon, after the market had closed. Targ, of course, would take him to the site—either Fisherman’s <a id="filepos602726"></a>Wharf or the Transamerica building—that corresponded to the market’s movement.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Thus, if Harary, on Sunday evening, descended into his zone and smelled ocean air and fish, and heard the cries of seagulls, Targ would assume that he was describing Fisherman’s Wharf, and would instruct their broker to bet on a down market for Monday. If Harary felt vertigo and sensed that he was soaring above a city, Targ would assume that he was describing the Transamerica building and would bet on an upward market.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It started as an experiment, but after Harary had made two successful predictions of the daily market for a particular silver-futures option, an investor jumped in, betting real money, and Harary had seven more “hits.” Targ began to calculate how long it would take them, at this rate, to become masters of the financial universe. But then, after a break of several weeks, the project suffered two “misses” in a row, and the investor bailed out of the project. Targ blamed Harary for losing his nerve. Harary blamed Targ for mis-analyzing his remote-viewing data. The blame-throwing broke out in public a few months later, during a lecture by Harary (with interruptions by Targ) at a conference at the Esalen Institute. Afterward Harary slapped Targ with a $1.5 million lawsuit, which was settled only after three years of further acrimony and countersuit. As late as the autumn of 1992, the two were still exchanging angry correspondence in parapsychology journals.</p>
