<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Amalgam Illness</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> arrived in the mail. I read it cover to cover in two days. It confirmed everything I’d suspected. Mercury was at the root of it all. It was a sneaky, broad-ranging toxin that attacked almost every system in the body. Fixing this was not going to be a simple matter. It had taken years for things to go wrong, it wasn’t just a case of waving a magic wand and everything would be made right. I cursed the day that I sat in Dr. Whelan’s chair and gave the wrong answer to the question: <span class="italic">Silver or white?</span> The more I read, the more information I absorbed, the angrier I got. Mitochondria? I didn’t even know they existed. They were supposed to fill my cells with energy? And mercury was screwing that up? Great. Fucking awesome.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Amalgam Illness</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> was full of advice on how to treat mercury poisoning, it laid out a whole plan of action. The first step was to get on some supplements. The whole second half of the book was basically a long list of vitamins, herbs and minerals that could knock mercury symptoms on the head. As I turned the pages, I made a list of the ones that might help my particular problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Some of these supplements I was currently taking, like milk thistle. Others were old friends like ginkgo biloba and chromium. I had known that they had helped me in the past. Why on Earth had I stopped taking them? It was all vanity. I had enjoyed the image of being a healthy person, someone who didn’t need that kind of support. So stupid.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Well vanity was out the window now. I pulled out all my supplement bottles, lined them up on the counter, and drove to the drugstore to buy an old-lady pill minder to keep track of them all.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">These supplements were:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Magnesium</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Milk Thistle</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Flax Oil Capsules</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Vitamin C</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Zinc</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Ginkgo Biloba</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Glutamine</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Chromium </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Probiotics</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Then I ordered some more likely candidates online:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Vitamin E</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">CoQ10</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Forskolin</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Digestive enzymes with ox bile</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">B3 as Niacinamide</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I also ordered the two over-the-counter chelators discussed in <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span>—Alpha Lipoic Acid and DMSA. When they arrived, I put them to one side. I wasn’t at all sure that I would ever use them. Chelators were powerful drugs that were chemically structured to enter the body, stir up mercury, grab onto little atoms of it, and usher it out of the body via urine or feces. The more I read about their effects on other people on the Frequent Dose Chelation Yahoo Group, the surer I became that these drugs would cause overwhelmingly nasty side effects if I ever took them. Still, I wanted to have them around just in case.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When the supplements arrived in the mail, I opened up the bottles and tried to jam them into the already-packed compartments of the old-lady pill minder. They wouldn’t fit. I had to drive back to the drugstore and upgrade to the jumbo size.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The first regular-sized pill holder ended up housing my breakfast supplements, and the jumbo took care of the dinner supplements, which were much greater in number because they included eight flax oil capsules. The few stray extras that went with lunch or at bedtime, I took straight out of the bottle. And every day I still drank a little aloe vera juice with a drop of peppermint oil, a pinch of slippery elm and a squirt of cayenne tincture. These were what I identified as the ‘gentle’ elements of the bowel cleanse I had been on. I didn’t want to stop taking them because I felt that they were doing something good for my colon. My new regimen made me think of a fragment of a poem I’d read when I was young:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Every day for their ills</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">They take dozens of pills</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">So they rattle like mad when they run </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I hoped that these dozens of pills were going to have some kind of positive effect.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I could definitely feel the supplements making a difference. My mood got a bit lighter. But since I was so far in the hole, ‘a bit lighter’ was still far from okay. And unsurprisingly, within days, I started having some side effects. Niacinamide didn’t sit well with me, which was predictable as I’d reacted badly to taking B complex in the past. CoQ10 made me feel good in the couple of hours after I took it, but it also made my heart pound in an alarming way, even if I was sitting doing nothing. I tried a lower dose but the same thing happened, so I stopped taking it. Forskolin seemed to be bringing me back to my old hypoglycemic days, so I quit that too. Back on zinc, the nausea reminded me why I’d stopped taking it in the first place. Cutler stressed how important it was for mercury toxic people to address their zinc deficiency, so I did my best to take a tiny nibble of the chewable whenever I could stand it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The digestive enzymes were hard to judge. They seemed to make my stomach burn a little bit when I took them. I tried only taking them with meals that were heavy in protein, and that seemed to help. Were they making a difference in how I felt? The jury was out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I settled into my new regimen, and after a week or two, the day dawned when I thought, Well, this is as good as things are going to get if I only use supplements.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It wasn’t anywhere near good enough.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That wasn’t a big surprise, given what I was going through. I learned from <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span> that my body was in the throes of a viciously powerful mercury detox reaction. People on the forums affectionately referred to it as ‘The Dump Phase.’ During my many years of exposure to amalgam, my cells and organs had slowly gotten filled up with mercury. But after those amalgams got removed, there was no more mercury coming in. My falling mercury levels had made me feel great in the weeks after amalgam removal.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But once my bloodstream got clear enough, the automatic detox began. The dam burst, and all the mercury stored up in my cells started pouring out. What had trickled in slowly over a period of 16 years, was now gushing out in a period of 16 months. My kidneys and liver couldn’t excrete the stuff fast enough. I was drowning in mercury, and there wasn’t a thing I could do about it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That wasn’t technically true. There was something I could do about it, but I was afraid to take that step. The next logical thing for me to try was chelation.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The chelation protocol described in <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span> didn’t involve any scary injections or IVs. It wasn’t meant to invoke an unbearable healing crisis. On the contrary, the protocol was designed to remove mercury from the body as carefully and gently as possible. I read this and I tried to believe it, but I still doubted it. How could it be gentle enough for me? My body couldn’t tolerate chocolate. If meat made me bleed, how on earth could I withstand the side effects of mercury-mobilizing drugs?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I needed to talk through my options, but I couldn’t bring this to my girlfriend. Life with her over the past month had been one continuous rolling ongoing fight. When we spoke, I did my best to be reasonable, but it was like I was possessed, like a mercury demon was using me as a mouthpiece. Every conversation devolved into conflict. I believed that she still loved me, but I was also pretty sure at this point that she didn’t particularly like me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">So I took it to my therapist.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” I began. “It turns out that I’ve been poisoned.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I see,” she said. “You feel poisoned.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No!” I said. “Work with me here! I have been literally poisoned. In the real world. Not in some metaphorical way. By mercury.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was hopeless. There was so much to explain. <span class="italic">Your dentist shouldn’t have given you chlorella. What is chlorella?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The whole hour was up before I’d even gotten anywhere near the burning question. Should I do this? Should I take DMSA? What if it did terrible things to me?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When I got home, I got online and searched the Frequent Dose Chelation forum for mentions of starting DMSA. <span class="italic">It made my gums bleed</span>, someone said. That was worrying. Would my bleeding hemorrhoid get out of control like it had during amalgam removal? Then someone else said, <span class="italic">It acted like an antidepressant for me. Thank God for DMSA.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">A tiny fire of hope ignited inside me. I ran a search for ‘DMSA antidepressant’ and it popped up all over. What if it did that for me too?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">So a few days later, I embarked on my first round of chelation with DMSA. A ‘round’ in the Frequent Dose Chelation protocol meant taking DMSA at regular four-hour intervals around the clock for three days without stopping. This included waking up at night to take doses. I gathered up all the clocks and watches in the house that had alarms, and decided that a noon-4pm-8pm-midnight-4am-8am schedule would be the easiest to keep track of with its multiples of the number 4. I set three alarm clocks for the nighttime doses, and decided the kitchen timer would do for the daytime.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Cutler recommended 50 to 100mg of DMSA per dose. The four hour timing interval was set in stone, but doses were flexible. I decided to try 12.5mg. I figured I could handle a quarter of what the average person could take, and besides, it was exactly half of a 25mg capsule.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Splitting the contents of a capsule in half was no joke, especially the teeny ones that DMSA came in. It wasn’t just a case of getting the capsule and dumping half of it down the sink. DMSA was pricey, thirty dollars a bottle. I couldn’t throw half of it out. I had some empty capsules that I’d bought at the health food store, large ones it was easy to pour powder into. So I dumped the contents of the tiny DMSA capsule onto a piece of paper, used a knife to divide the pile in half, then carefully brushed each pile onto a folded post-it note to pour it into the large empty capsules. It was a tricky, painstaking process. I got tired of it after making up half a dozen doses, enough to cover one day. Side effects would probably halt this whole process by then, anyway. I decided not to make up any more.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took my first dose at noon, and waited to see what would happen. It was pretty subtle, but over the next hour, I could feel the dose taking hold. It wasn’t anything bad, I just felt a little spaced out. I could feel it winding down after three hours, and then ramping up again after I took my dose at 4pm. It really wasn’t a big deal.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My 8pm dose was fine, but one of the alarms didn’t go off at midnight, and I was late taking the dose. It was okay to take it when I actually woke up at 12:17am, because it wasn’t more than an hour late. Otherwise, I would have had to stop the round. I wasn’t sure what had woken me. I had been in the middle of a vivid dream where my head was below my shoulders, all of my body parts were rearranged.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I woke on time at 4am, taking my dose by the light of a flashlight, so as not to disturb my girlfriend. I fell back into an endless night of dreams that felt so real, it was almost like I was awake while I was dreaming.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My second day on round I was supposed to work at the school farm program. Getting up in the morning wasn’t a problem. I had decided the night before that I would call in sick if I needed to, but as far as I could tell, I felt perfectly fine. My 8am dose didn’t even seem to have a great effect on me, so instead of going to the bother of splitting more capsules, I decided to go ahead and try 25mg for my second day of chelation.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I wasn’t going to carry my kitchen timer around with me at work, so I set noon and 4pm alarms on my digital watch. I was helping one of the interns, clearing out stalls when our work was interrupted by the alarm on my watch sounding at noon.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Time for lunch,” I announced, immediately downing tools and heading for the lunchroom, where my bottle of pills sat in my coat pocket. I didn’t want to get sidetracked and forget to take my dose.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The school day happened to end at 4pm, just in time for my next dose, and I wound up working with the same intern when my alarm went off again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I guess it’s quitting time,” I said, hastily putting away my tools and going to fetch my coat.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You set an alarm for that?” she called after me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I turned around and shrugged. “I guess.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On my way home from work, I looked back over my day. I had assisted with horse riding classes, cleaned out stalls, carried buckets of feed all over the place. Just like every Tuesday, I’d been on my feet all day, working like a dog. But unlike other Tuesdays, coming home on the train, I wasn’t slumped with exhaustion. I wasn’t pining for my couch, where I could sit and stuff my face to feed my bottomless hunger until I collapsed into bed. This Tuesday, I felt as fresh at the end of the day as I did at the beginning. I began to entertain the thought that something good was happening.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On the third day of the round, I doubled my dose again to 50mg, since 25mg had gone so well. I went out and did my shopping, coming up with good ideas for sewing projects when I visited the local craft store. The day was perfectly pleasant, except I had a slight headache throughout the day, and my gums felt a little tender, just as expected. I took my last dose at 4pm, and at 8 o’clock, when it was all wearing off and winding down, I was in the kitchen, talking to my girlfriend as we prepared dinner.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We were having a good couple of days, and I felt that it was time to open up to her a little about my recent discoveries. I was explaining chelation to her while she chopped broccoli and I got out the tomato sauce. As I talked, I began to feel kind of stoned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How long do you chelate for?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“People usually do three days on and four days off,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” she said. “I mean, how many weeks do you do the rounds for before you get better?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Not weeks,” I said. “Months. It’s going to be months before my dump phase is over. I’m pretty sure it’s going to take another six months. Maybe more.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And you’ll be better then?” she asked. “When? Late next spring? Early summer?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It depends,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Cutler talked a lot in <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span> about the mercury stored in the brain. It didn’t pour out during the dump phase, it was trapped behind the blood brain barrier. Brain mercury was actually the cause of a lot of ‘body’ symptoms, because the brain was the control center for so many of the body’s processes. The only way to fix those mercury symptoms was to do weekly rounds with a different chelator called ALA.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What does it depend on?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How much mercury made it into my brain while I had amalgams,” I said. “There’s no way to test it. But that’s the big measure of how bad it is. My case of broccoli poisoning—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She laughed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I mean, mercury poisoning.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I stood in the middle of the kitchen and looked around scratching my head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Where did I put the sauce?” I asked, bewildered.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend found the full jar, sitting in the sink with the lid off. She took me by the hand and led me to a stool.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You sit here, and I’ll finish the cooking,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I sat and watched her cook, and enjoyed the stoned feeling that rolled over me. By the time an hour had passed, it had faded, and that was the end of my first round of chelation.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went on the Frequent Dose Chelation board to write a report on how it went. When I checked back the next day, I found some cheerful but alarmed responses from five different people:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">“I would stick with a fairly low dose for several rounds before increasing. Better safe than sorry.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">“You should not be increasing your dose within a round! You can only increase the dose when you start a new round. Please be careful.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had no idea that I had been going too fast, or doing something that wasn’t recommended. The book said that 50 to 100mg was the recommended dose. I later found out that the Frequent Dose Chelation Yahoo group recommendations were to start very low, at 12.5mg like I had, and not increase your dose until you’d completed three rounds. I felt a bit sheepish that I had been caught doing it wrong, but far more than that, I was glad that these people were watching out for me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I’d read that there were after-effects, called ‘redistribution,’ that surfaced in the 24 to 48 hours after a round ended, so I watched to see what would happen. My hemorrhoid started bleeding the day after the round ended, for the first time in a while. But for the next few days, everything was good.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then, the following week, I began to feel terrible again. Technically, I could have started another round of DMSA. I had done a three-day round, and the required three-day break was over. But my hemorrhoid was still bleeding. I didn’t want to make it worse by chelating some more. I stopped taking vitamin C and that slowed the bleeding a bit, but each day, I felt the mercury darkness crowding in on me. Everything in my life felt fraught with difficulty. Every thought seemed to lead down the same cul-de-sac of despair. The mercury monster was gaining ground in my head again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I started my second round, sticking with a consistent 25mg of DMSA this time. An hour after my first dose, all the difficulty and despair lifted. While on round, my hemorrhoid stopped bleeding. Everything was easier, life was manageable. I had calm and loving conversations with my girlfriend. I felt like a normal and reasonable human being.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The side effects on this second round were minimal. My dreams were vivid again, but less so than last time. I also was less spaced out on this round. I was disappointed that I didn’t have the stoned feeling when I came off it at the end, but was glad that my body was getting used to DMSA and its effects.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t believe how well things were going. It looked like I had found the answer to my problems. It truly felt like magic. All I had to do now was find the best balance between being on round and being off round, and everything would be fine. I’d have a good chance of making it through the dump phase alive.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My next round was short, not because I planned it that way, but because the 4am alarm failed to wake me in the middle of the second night. I took a few days off, and trying to stay ahead of the mercury, got right back on round again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This time, I planned to do a round that was seven days long. I hadn’t heard of anybody chelating continuously with DMSA, but I’d heard of people doing schedules that were a week on round followed by a week off. If my rounds were longer, maybe I’d be able to find my feet during the long days of reprieve. Chelation was great, I wasn’t knocking it, but I was beginning to feel like a yo-yo at the end of a string, bouncing up and down as the rounds came and went. And since the redistribution after-effects were caused by mobilized mercury crashing into the body’s tissues, it would be healthier to reduce the frequency of them to twice a month rather than every single week.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Redistribution usually hit me 36 hours after I took my last dose. And indeed, 36 hours after I finished the weeklong round, I wasn’t feeling great. In fact, I was feeling really weird. I’d felt poorly since I’d gotten up that morning. I’d woken from a night of sleep reminiscent of the time the dentist had given me garlic capsules. It had been one long grueling nightmare, where I’d kept thinking I was waking up, but always I ended up in another nasty dream.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When I’d finally woken up for real to go to work at the farm, I’d been eager to leave my bed and enter the real world. But sitting on the bus going to work, things didn’t feel as real as they should. I stared out the window, taking slow, deep calming breaths. This didn’t seem to help. It crossed my mind that I was going to pass out. I held my hands out in front of me, but I didn’t have the usual stiffness and tingling in my limbs that was my big passing-out warning sign.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I looked at the other passengers on the bus, their backs to me, sitting so still. It suddenly became clear to me that they were not real human beings. They were just bodies, without thoughts or emotions. Empty breathing flesh. I stared out the window again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This was not good. This was mercury. Redistributing. Into my brain. Right here on the bus. Wiping out my ability to recognize humanity. If I screamed or passed out, would the non-humans around me even notice? Was I even on the bus? Had I ever really woken up? Was I still trapped in a dream? Or was I actually on the bus, but dying?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">These thoughts ran through my mind, while a calm, rational part of me analyzed them. I probably wasn’t dying, but I wasn’t well. There was nothing I could do except go home and lie down. I would stay on the bus until it looped around back to the train station. I would go home and go to bed. I would be fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then, mercifully, it passed. The people were people again. It wasn’t a dream. I was fine. In fact, I felt so fine, I got off at my stop and did my day of work without a problem. The whole thing had lasted maybe ten minutes. Just a little redistribution event.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But I never did a long round again. In the run up to Christmas, I settled down into a pattern of 3 days on, 4 days off. It turned out that 36 hours after my round ended, I was often on that same bus going to work. I had a couple more ‘moments,’ but nothing as intense as that first one. I was glad. I didn’t want to stop chelating. DMSA was my life preserver, keeping me afloat in the mercury ocean. Keeping my head above water in the slow tsunami of the dump phase.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I spent a lot of time studying the graph of the dump phase in <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span>, wondering when the tide would turn, how long my personal bell curve of mercury suffering would last. I knew that the signal that I’d reached the top of the curve would be that my symptoms would decrease in intensity. But as the rounds went by, whenever I wasn’t on DMSA, the mercury madness felt like it was gaining ground.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">By the time Christmas rolled around, I had completed my 6th round of DMSA. My girlfriend and I were celebrating the holiday alone together, and it wasn’t easy coming up with a menu that fit all of my dietary restrictions. At this point, I couldn’t tolerate gluten, meat, sugar, caffeine, milk, nuts, bananas, potatoes…the list went on. We settled on mac and cheese made with rice milk and rice pasta, pancakes made from spaghetti squash, and buttered peas.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In honor of my Irish heritage, I handmade Christmas crackers, and stuffed them with crepe paper hats, plastic toys and jokes. I was very pleased with myself when I wrote an original joke based on our cat’s name. (Q: What do you call a process in which a cat wakes you up at midnight, 4am and 8am precisely? A: Blackielation.)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had been off sugar since the summer because of my persistent yeast problems, but the combination of probiotics and the parasite cleanse seemed to have kept the hysterical yeast infections at bay. Still, the tinea versicolor fungal rash was pretty active. It had spread from my chest, and was now appearing on my back, arms and neck too. But it wasn’t itchy, didn’t bother me and would go away as soon as I got around to buying some jock itch cream to put on it. Given the fact that things were under control, I decided it would be okay to eat a little sugar, just once, for Christmas.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Hearing about my decision, my girlfriend decided to go all out, and bought a box of gluten free angel food cake mix. We didn’t own an electric mixer, so on Christmas Eve, we spent a couple of hours taking turns with an egg beater, cranking away until our arms got sore and we had to hand off to the other person. The mix was thoroughly beaten when we were done, and the cake was a sight to behold when it came out of the oven, light and fluffy and beautiful.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Christmas Dinner was lovely. Cake for dessert was even lovelier. It was my first taste of sugar in months. I had been experimenting with stevia, an herbal sweetener, and putting lots of cinnamon and vanilla essence in my baking to make it seem sweeter. But nothing could duplicate the real thing. Sugar was awesome, I could feel it melting in my mouth and making its way into my bloodstream immediately. I could understand why they used to call it ‘crack’ in the old days.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next day, I had another little slice of cake, followed by another, and then one for the road. I stopped there, because I knew that I was slipping into territory where I may regret my actions. I asked my girlfriend to take the rest of the cake away, I didn’t want to have anything more to do with it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The following day I felt out of sorts. It didn’t feel like mercury, it was a different kind of tired and irritable, and didn’t know what to do with myself. I tried to keep busy, run my errands and snap out of it. But by the end of the day, I felt quite a bit worse, and could feel the beginnings of a sore throat. I went to the mirror to see how red it looked, and when I opened my mouth, I saw not just redness but spots! I had strep!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took to my bed for a week, feeling hideous. My girlfriend had to bring me all my meals because I could barely sit up. I was miserable, and when I had enough energy to think about it, I berated myself for foolishly playing around with sugar. Mercury was notorious for screwing with the immune system. My various yeast and fungal problems were proof of that. And now I’d gone and helped it by spooning a big dose of immune-suppressing sugar into the mix. Stupid!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">By New Year’s Eve, I wasn’t well yet, and our plans to go into the city for the night were scrapped. I was able to sit up for a few hours and play a board game with my girlfriend and watch a DVD, but I wasn’t feeling great. It wasn’t just the strep. I had postponed my next round of DMSA because I was sick, and the mercury was crowding into my head. I was losing my grip on myself. I decided to start a round right away.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The days after that round were hideous, I had redistribution followed by two days of menstrual cramps. Every round, it seemed brought worse redistribution than the round before. And the mercury madness was creeping back sooner and sooner. My windows of clarity were getting shorter and shorter. And bouncing back and forth between days of sanity and days of mercury madness was eroding my grip on reality. I began to wonder how much more of it I could take. Was this dump phase ever going to peak?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On a good day in the middle of the next round, I sat my girlfriend down.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I want to apologize,” I said. “For how I’ve been these past few months. The mercury makes me scared, and when I get scared, I try to control everything around me. Including you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s okay,” she said. “It’s not like I’ve been on top of my game either. Let’s just try to be better, okay?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I closed my eyes for a second, doing my best to come up with words that would explain what I needed to say.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s the thing,” I said. “I don’t think I can be better. The mercury’s not going away as fast as I’d hoped. There’s a good chance I’m going to get worse.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But you’re doing your rounds,” she protested. “You’ve figured it out.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I shook my head. “The DMSA isn’t keeping up with it,” I said. “Things are getting harder.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean, ‘harder’?” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Just promise me something,” I said. “That you’ll take care of things. For us. Make decisions for us. If I tell you I can’t trust my judgment anymore.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re sounding a bit crazy right now,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “This is me being sane. This is why I need to tell you this now. Because I may not be able to communicate with you later on.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Why?” she asked. “Where are you going?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m not going anywhere,” I said. “Please. Please promise me that you’ll take care of things. If it looks like I’m not able to.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay, but I don’t believe you. I think you’re overreacting.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Promise me,” I insisted.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay, okay, I promise.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I heaved a sigh of relief. “Thanks.”</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The dump phase continued to intensify over the winter. On bad days I clamped down hard and didn’t let the mercury demon use me as a mouthpiece. Things got very quiet in our house. It was hard to contain the fear and despair that mercury evoked inside me. It was hard too, to resist the urge to talk things through with my girlfriend. She had always been there for me when I needed her. But I knew that if I began, if I let it out, the mercury demon would inevitably turn the conversation into a hurtful fight. There was nothing real about the thoughts and feelings that came up when the mercury was running high. I did my best to tune out, to ignore whatever jumbled horror was going on in my head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Ignoring my mercury-induced thoughts and feelings took its toll on my relationship with my girlfriend, but it also eroded my relationship with myself. After a while, it became hard to pick and choose what I was supposed to ignore. I began to automatically suspect the reality of all of my feelings, even the positive ones. I grew distanced from myself, always ready to put up a wall between me and not-me. But still, I couldn’t think of any better way of handling what was going on inside me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My immune system wasn’t doing so well either. My body was losing its ability to kill yeast. I joined a candida and yeast forum and began to try out different kinds of natural yeast remedies. Some worked for a little while and then got overpowered, others never worked at all.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went back to the Frequent Dose Chelation group, looking for answers there. Surely other mercury toxic people had struggled with yeast too. I posted about it, and then went looking through the files section.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Almost immediately I found a document called ‘Neutrophils, Yeast and DMSA.’ From it, I learned the illuminating fact that DMSA had a tendency to lower neutrophil numbers. And what were neutrophils? They were the white blood cells that were in charge of killing yeast!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Of course! My yeast problems were intensifying not because the dump phase was intensifying, but because I had been taking so much DMSA. It was killing off my poor neutrophils, and causing the yeast to run wild. When I thought about it, there was no reason for my dump phase to be going on and on like this. In fact, it was probably already over, but this fact was masked by my monstrous case of yeast. My course of action was clear. All I had to do was stop taking DMSA and everything would be fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I posted about this on the Frequent Dose Chelation forum. I felt sure that they’d all be blown away by my detective work. Identifying that my dump phase was really over, but masked by a case of yeast? Brilliant!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The moderator of the group replied:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">“Andy [Cutler] usually says to keep chelating through the gut problems (and to look for ways to address them). I took an extended break since about last March, when I had a serious infection…the break didn't seem to help anything and I'm counting on chelation to make me feel better.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This took the wind out of my sails. Wasn’t it obvious that I was right? Andy’s advice sounded way off. Chelating through my yeast problem would involve having to take something big to knock my yeast back, a prescription antifungal. I had no intention of turning up at a doctor’s office, asking for help from some idiot who knew less than nothing about mercury. That was the last thing I wanted to do.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It didn’t matter anyway. My solution was going to work. All I had to do was stop taking DMSA. My neutrophils would bounce back, the yeast would go away and everything would be fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I quit taking DMSA.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two weeks later, I had totally lost it. Yes, the first week off had been good. The yeast had died down, my color had returned, I’d felt stronger and clearer than I had in a while. But then the mercury horror had reasserted itself. With a vengeance. It was worse than I’d ever experienced before. I was now utterly non-functional. I couldn’t make it through the day without getting into bed and sleeping for hours, and I couldn’t hold a thought in my head for a second. It had all seemed like a good idea at first, but the smothering cloud of mercury felt unbearable, and as the days went by, it showed no signs of lifting.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I tried to tough it out, but by day 16 off DMSA, I couldn’t stand it for one more minute. I caved, and started a round of DMSA. Within an hour, I was feeling better.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I knew now that my dump phase wasn’t over. I needed DMSA to get me though. And I knew that I was going to have to get a prescription to take care of the yeast. I looked online, but Diflucan or Nystatin weren’t the kinds of things you could buy on eBay. I was going to have to swallow my pride and go to some idiot doctor and ask for help. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I decided to go to the holistic doctor that had his practice next to the local health food store and yoga studio. He’d probably be crackers, but being holistic, there was a chance that he wouldn’t write me off automatically as a hypochondriac. I called and made an appointment.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But before I could go see him, I had to go on vacation. Long before I’d gotten sick, my girlfriend’s mother had asked us to accompany her to London. My sister lived in London too, so it all worked out nicely. My girlfriend and I would stay with her, while the older generation hung out at my girlfriend’s aunt’s.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As I got all my supplements ready for the trip, I realized that I didn’t have enough DMSA to complete my next round. I’d been so gung-ho about quitting that I hadn’t ordered another bottle when I started running low. I got online and ordered it immediately, hoping that it would arrive before we left on the trip.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It didn’t.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I brought along the half-round I had, vaguely thinking that I would grit my teeth for a couple of days, and then start the round right before I left. It would be fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It wasn’t.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had been stretching the gap between rounds to minimize DMSA’s effect on my yeast. I’d managed to stretch it up to twelve days off before we left on our trip. It looked like I was going to be okay for the first week and a half of the trip. But after fourteen days off, the mercury descended on me with a thump. I expected it to make me tired like it had the time I’d tried to quit DMSA. That would be fine. My sister was cool. I could just lie in bed and chat with her and have the kids play around us on the bed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But this time, the mercury didn’t only make me tired. It also had a profound effect on my brain. It emptied out and I was blank. No words inside me. Normally there was always something going on inside my head, even if it was mercury garbage. Now things had gone eerily quiet.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend, picking up that something was wrong, began to follow me around my sister’s house. I found an empty room and sat there, relieved to be alone, but a couple of minutes later, my girlfriend appeared and sat beside me. Right beside me! I couldn’t stand it! I felt that if she asked me a question, I’d scream.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I got up and left the room and found somewhere quiet, but she followed me all over again. This went on and on. And the eye contact! Excruciating. Why did everyone keep trying to look at me?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As the hours went by, things got stranger inside me. It was clear that I was acting very oddly and I had to explain to my sister and girlfriend what was going on. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I need to take DMSA, but I don’t have enough,” I said. “So this is what’s happening to me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My sister wrote down ‘DMSA’ on a piece of paper and said she’d ask the chemist about it the next day.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m pretty sure it’s not the kind of thing they stock at Boots,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went to bed, hoping that the worst was over.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was alone when I woke up the next morning, my girlfriend had gone to meet a friend for lunch. I was relieved to be alone, because I felt absolutely desperate. My brain felt entirely alien to me. I needed to think and figure out what was the best thing to do. Take a day and a bit of DMSA? That wasn’t a full round. What if it wore off really quickly? Then I’d be bonkers on a transatlantic flight.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Should I try to get it from someone else? I knew that there were English people on the Frequent Dose Chelation board, but posts didn’t appear instantly, and just because they were in England, didn’t mean they were in London. And what if they used a different brand? It could go horribly wrong. Anyway, with my brain in the state it was in, I couldn’t begin to frame an appropriate way to ask.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Then an idea hit me. I could split the capsules. I could have an almost full round if I split each capsule in half. But no. I didn’t have any empty capsules to put the other halves in. It was too hard.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I began to weep. I knew that I wasn’t going to stop weeping until I had taken some DMSA. Then I thought, Glutamine! I could empty out the contents of glutamine capsules and use them for the other halves.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At this point, my girlfriend walked in the door and took in the scene. I was sitting on the edge of the bed, clutching a bottle of DMSA in one hand and a bottle of glutamine in the other, crying my eyes out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What’s going on?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She sat quietly on the bed beside me and listened to the whole plan of splitting the capsules and emptying the glutamine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” she said. “I’ll do it. Just tell me how to split the doses.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “I’ll do it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t bear the thought of having to find the words to explain about brushing the powder carefully and the crease in the post-it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’ve done it before,” I said. “I know how. It’s just going to be a bit harder cause I can’t stop crying. Just help me, okay?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” she said. “What do I do?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Empty out ten glutamine capsules down the sink,” I said. “Then find me a knife and some post-its.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She returned after a minute with everything.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What next?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sit right beside me,” I said. “With a tissue in your hand, and dab my eyes when I tell you to. I’m going to need both my hands and I won’t be able to see what I’m doing if my eyes are full of tears.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We did it. I took my first half dose and stopped crying soon after. My sister came up the stairs and said that she’d talked at length with the chemist who had never heard of DMSA, who had taken out a giant handbook of drugs and looked and looked through it and finally found a tiny section on it. If I wanted DMSA, I would have to go to the emergency room and get a drip. I declined the offer.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I stopped crying and had a bit more energy, but the half doses didn’t have the kick that I needed. I got up and joined in more, but really all I wanted to do was get in bed and burrow under the covers with my iPod Scrabble game.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I did that for a few hours a day, but wanted to get up for a special concert that my sister had bought tickets for months in advance. The concert was in Greenwich and there was a ferry on the Thames that would bring us there. My girlfriend wanted to see the Greenwich Mean Time line in the ground that was near there, so she and I set out early.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t have a lot to say on the train going into the city center. And when we got to Waterloo, the crowds were incredibly overwhelming. I let my girlfriend just lead the way and I trotted mutely along behind her. She figured out where the ferry was, bought the tickets and off we went.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was immediately hideous. I hated it. It felt like the boat was doing something terrible to me. I couldn’t help crying.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?” my girlfriend asked. “Do you need to get off? We’re stopping.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” I said. Whatever it was had passed as suddenly as it had come on. “I think I’m okay.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But then the boat took off again, and it felt like silent fingernails were scraping a chalkboard deep inside my brain.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh God,” I said, tears pouring down my face. “It‘s awful.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then it was over again. It took me a couple more stops to figure out that the acceleration of the boat was doing something to my brain. Whenever it sped up, I felt waves of intense distress. I would sob for thirty seconds, then the boat would stop accelerating and I’d feel fine. By the time I’d figured out what was going on, we’d gotten to our destination, and my girlfriend was figuring out a way to get me back to my sister’s house. I was done.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I just took out my headphones, turned my iPod up real loud, and wondered if this was what autistic kids felt like on the inside when they screamed and covered their ears and ran away.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I staggered through the rest of my stay in London, and arrived home feeling beaten. Right after I got home, I had to peel myself up off the floor and present myself at the doctor’s office. I felt terrible. I looked terrible. But I’d done my research and I knew what I wanted. All I had to say was, <span class="italic">I’m having persistent yeast problems and I need a prescription for Diflucan</span>. I’d read that American doctors didn’t mind if you did the diagnosing and prescribing for them. It saved them time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The practice was very nice, all modern glass and rough-hewn wood. I was shown into a room with two armchairs, a coffee table and not much else, and was told the doctor would be with me shortly. I found the room confusing. Where was all the medical paraphernalia? Where was the desk? Was the doctor going to just come in and sit in the other armchair and talk to me? That was so unlikely, doctors needed their props. This was probably just another waiting room.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">After a few minutes, the door opened and a tall, skinny man with curly hair popped in. I jumped up, ready to follow him to the examining room, but after he shook my hand and introduced himself, he indicated the armchairs and we sat down.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So,” he smiled broadly, “What can I do for you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I found the smile disconcerting. I’d never seen a doctor who seemed so happy to meet me before. But I knew my line and I trotted it out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’ve been having persistent yeast problems,” I said. “And I need a prescription for Diflucan.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sure, sure,” he said. “No problem. You’ve taken Diflucan before?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “But I’ve used an antifungal cream a lot that had clotrimazole as the active ingredient, so I figure I tolerate the -azole family of antifungals fine. You know, fluconazole, Diflucan.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” he said. “That’s fine. That makes sense.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I figured at this point that our business was done, but he wasn’t reaching into his pocket for a prescription pad. Was there going to be a catch?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So yeast,” he said, settling back and getting comfortable in his armchair. “What else is going on with you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Was this some kind of joke? I looked him over for some sign that he was messing with me, but his face and body language looked open and sincere.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Why not? I thought. The guy asked what was going on with me. I should give him an honest answer.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I have mercury poisoning,” I said. “I got it from my amalgam fillings. I’ve been chelating using 25mg of DMSA taken at 4 hour intervals around the clock for three-day rounds. It’s a protocol described by Andrew Hall Cutler in his book <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span>.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Cutler, yes,” he said. “I’ve heard of him. But who’s prescribing your DMSA?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nobody,” I said. “You can just buy it on the internet.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You can?” he laughed. “Wow. And you’re just doing this on your own?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yup.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Are you taking any supplements?” he asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh yeah,” I said. “Lots.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Like what?” he said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> The notebook with my supplement list happened to be in my bag, so I took it out, opened it to the page and handed it to him. In for a penny, in for a pound.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">He looked it over.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Why cayenne pepper?” he asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I dunno,” I said. “It was part of a bowel cleanse I did.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Magnesium, yes. Flax oil, yes.” He looked up. “Why no vitamin C?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I explained about the bleeding hemorrhoid, and how blood-thinning C made it worse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s so necessary, though,” he said. “With heavy metal issues. Have you tried taking it in a different form? Something like Rose Hips. That would probably help your hemorrhoid, not make it worse.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re right,” I said. “I hadn’t thought of that.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And your adrenals,” he said. “Are you taking anything to support your adrenals?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The conversation went on, we covered my adrenals, and then moved on to the theory behind chelation protocols. I started to really enjoy myself. I had never spoken to a real live human being before who understood what heavy metal toxicity was all about. He had even chelated some of his patients.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I see it in my own patients,” he said. “People do better on lower doses of chelators. It’s got to come out slowly. So can I interest you in a DMSA challenge test?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. Cutler was adamant on this. Taking a large dose of a chelator just to see how much mercury came out in your pee was an easy way to get very very sick from redistribution.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You can learn a lot from it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No thanks,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” he said. “I respect that. I’m not going to push it on you. But how about some blood work? Just to see where everything’s at.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I surprised myself by saying, “Yeah, okay.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">He took a little pad out of his pocket.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And here’s your prescription for Diflucan,” he said. “Five days. You’re going to get some die-off, it can get quite intense, but if you can, see if you can make it through the whole five days.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">He stood up, and before handing me off to the nurse for blood work, he paused and looked at me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Heavy metals are hard,” he said. “But you’re managing this really well. You’re basically strong and healthy. I can see it, you’re going to be fine.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went to the nurse for blood work, and then stopped at the front desk to pick up a bottle of herbal adrenal formula and to pay my bill. I handed over hundreds of dollars that my health insurance would probably never cover. Still, it was worth it. I walked out to my car, fingering the prescription for Diflucan in my pocket, and thinking, I’m managing this really well, I’m basically strong and healthy, I’m going to be fine.</span></span></span></p>
