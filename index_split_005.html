<p class="calibre_14">However, I hope the skeptical reader will bear in mind that this book was put together with the standard techniques of investigative journalism. I conducted numerous interviews with people who participated at all levels in the events I describe. I cross-checked stories among sources, and I gathered as much relevant documentary evidence as I could. In the back of the book I have noted the source(s) of each significant piece of information in the text. Were the subject of this book a different kind of classified government program—say, the effort to develop radar-evading Stealth aircraft—it would not be necessary to say any of this.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Because so many of the projects and operations discussed in these pages are still classified, some of my sources spoke to me on the condition that I identify them, as sources, in general terms only—e.g., “a former senior CIA official.” This is the kind of practice commonly used, and often abused, in books about classified matters. However, most of the sources for this book spoke to me openly, “on the record.” This is their story, not a dramatic invention of mine.</p>
