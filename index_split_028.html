<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">O</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">N ONE OF THE FLOORS BELOW THE REMOTE-VIEWING LAB AT</span></span> SRI, there was a metal-shielded “secure room” with a special fax machine protected by an encryption system. Occasionally a classified tasking would come through on the fax machine from Washington, and someone from the secure room would carry it up to Hal Puthoff.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day in May 1978, Puthoff was handed a special classified fax from General Ed Thompson’s office at the Pentagon. Apparently Thompson had sent it on behalf of the CIA. It was an urgent tasking concerning a Soviet Tupolev-22 bomber—a type code-named “Blinder” by NATO—that had been lost somewhere in Zaire. A day or so before, apparently on an intelligence-gathering mission over central Africa,<a id="filepos497707" href="#filepos525476">*</a> it had somehow crashed in the jungle. If the wreckage could be found by American spies before the Soviets reached it, it could be sifted through for valuable <a></a>clues to Soviet intelligence targets and techniques. The Soviet Union’s loss could be America’s gain.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Unfortunately, though U.S. spy satellites had surveyed the area, looking for visual or infrared evidence of a downed craft, they had come up with nothing. The plane seemed to have been swallowed up by the jungle.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff by this time had perhaps a dozen remote viewers to choose from, including Ingo Swann, Hella Hammid, and a man named Gary Langford at SRI, plus a few freelancers scattered around the country. He chose Langford for this mission. Langford was an SRI computer expert in his mid-thirties. Somehow it had been found that he had more than the average psi talent. He was tall and slim with a quiet, polite manner, and though he seemed in his element in front of a keyboard, he was not as eccentric as some of the other remote viewers. Down in his remote-viewing zone, he appeared to be particularly good against high-tech intelligence targets; his broad technical knowledge enabled him to describe the things he was psychically perceiving with a precision and an eye for detail unavailable to his more artistically oriented colleagues. He was also relatively good at using remote viewing to find things. There were times when he began to seem like a new Pat Price.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff walked with Langford into the RV room, which Ingo Swann had constructed a few years earlier. It was a soundproofed space with blank grayish white walls, a gray carpet, and a gray conference-type table. The lights were kept dim, to avoid any bright spots in the room. SRI’s research had found that bright spots tended to leave afterimages on the remote viewer’s retinas, images that in turn could invade the remote viewer’s data when the session began. With the lights dimmed, there were no such distractions. The room was a warm gray cocoon.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The two men sat at either end of the table. Before them lay pens and stacks of paper. Above them, like watchful <a></a>bats, hung two black video cameras that were to record the session. Langford sat quietly for a few minutes, calming his mind, and then Puthoff turned on the cameras and placed the target envelope on the table. The target, he told Lang-ford, was a lost aircraft.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Within ten minutes Langford was sensing a river in a jungle. The plane was there, but most of it was submerged. Langford sketched a battered tail section jutting up from the river’s brown and turbulent surface. He also tried to sketch the surrounding area, with terrain and roads, but it wasn’t clear whether there would be enough detail to isolate the location. Still, Puthoff was confident that the search should be concentrated along the rivers in the region of the crash.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff faxed the information back to the Pentagon, and then sat back and waited.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Air Force physicist Dale Graff was also considering the Zaire problem. Graff, at the Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, was a thin, absentminded professor type, with a long passion for psi. He liked to keep track of his dreams, and for a while in the late 1970s, had tried to communicate telepathically with a friend who lived across town. Each had scanned his or her dream content, to try to find material that had secretly been sent by the other. Graff taught a parapsychology course on the side, at a community college near Wright-Pat. A strong backer of Grill Flame, he was one of SRI’s current funders; his contract tasked Puthoff and his associates with the duplication of some psi experiments the Soviets and Chinese were reported to have done.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Graff also had put together a small, informal group of remote viewers at Wright-Patterson, one of the best of whom was a woman named Frances Bryan, who seemed to have a special talent for finding things. When Graff heard about the downed Soviet plane in Zaire and the failure of <a></a>efforts to find it, he sat Bryan down and gave her a photograph of a Tu-22. He told her that a similar plane had crashed somewhere in Africa.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Bryan’s resulting sketch of the crashed plane wasn’t as detailed as Langford’s, but she produced a better overhead view of the crash site and the river, with numerous prominent terrain features. Graff matched the sketch to an area that turned out to be in the general region where the plane had gone down. A summary of Bryan’s and Langford’s data was sent via the Pentagon to the CIA’s Europe and Africa Division in the Directorate of Operations, which cabled the information—not mentioning the bizarre source—to the Agency’s station chief in Kinshasa.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The station chief wasn’t too impressed. The area indicated in the cable was about seventy miles to the west of the area where his team now believed the plane had gone down. He cabled back to headquarters asking for more precise information, and meanwhile continued his search. The request went along the chain of command and eventually reached Graff at Wright-Patterson and Puthoff at SRI. They studied more maps of the area, and eventually Graff’s office was able to match Fran Bryan’s sketch to a specific spot along a particular river. The coordinates of the spot were quickly cabled to the station chief in Zaire.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the time the coordinates arrived, the CIA’s team was already well on its way into the jungle, headed for the area they believed the plane had crashed. As they passed near the other area, the one specified by the coordinates sent from headquarters, they noticed something very strange. Natives were emerging from the bush with strange pieces of metal—ragged parts of what appeared to be a downed aircraft. The jungle had already begun to digest its captured prey.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Shortly thereafter, the CIA’s team found the main intact section of the downed plane. It was in the river Graff’s <a id="filepos504714"></a>office had indicated, within three miles of the given coordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The wreckage was quickly brought out of Zaire, and information about the Soviet plane, and Soviet intelligence-gathering activities in Africa, began to flow into the knowledge banks of U.S. spy agencies. For the CIA, it was a nice, neat victory, and its director, Stansfield Turner, was pleased to inform President Carter of the successful recovery effort.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Yes, but how did you recover it so quickly? the President wanted to know.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Uncertain what the reaction would be, Turner mentioned the role the psychics had played. Carter didn’t seem to mind at all. He knew about the SRI program from National Security Council staffer Jake Stewart, and Congressman Charlie Rose. He seemed to approve of the idea. Seventeen years later, still full of wonder over the Zaire incident, he would briefly recall it (with some erroneous details) to an audience of college students when asked about unusual events during his presidency.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Back in Menlo Park, Hal Puthoff was eventually shown a photograph of the wreckage site, and it was something that he too would never forget. The photo depicted a brown turbulent river and the jutting metal tail of the Soviet reconnaissance plane, so closely matched to Langford’s first sketch that it was as if the remote viewer had been there before any of them, hovering like a ghost in the trees, quietly seeing what no mortal eye had yet seen.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The drought was over. The rains had come. By the time of the Zaire operation, SRI was receiving funds from <a id="filepos506634"></a>half a dozen sources, including the DIA’s Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate (known as DT), and Dale Graff’s office out at Wright-Patterson. Soon General Thompson’s remote-viewing unit at Fort Meade would join in.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the rush of funders into the gap left by CIA had its downside. The lines of control were becoming tangled. The <a id="filepos507079"></a>contract monitors from the different funding offices were starting to compete for influence over SRI researchers and remote viewers. Skip Atwater and Scotty Watt would travel out to SRI, and would be told peremptorily by, say, the DIA’s contract monitor, Jim Salyer, that they couldn’t see a particular person because that person just then was preoccupied with secret work for Salyer. It was the kind of interagency rivalry that often gave defense industry contractors headaches.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eventually, an arrangement was made to reduce all the rivalry and the crossed signals. By the beginning of 1979 the funding and the work tasks were coordinated by the DIA, and the separate elements of the project became known by the collective code name Grill Flame. The integration of the project also provided attractive political cover for other agencies that might have been embarrassed to fund psychic spying directly. Atop this cover was a curly-haired former nuclear physicist, Jack Vorona, who headed the DIA’s DT section. As one of the Pentagon’s top scientists, Vorona was privy to some of the strangest, most secret research projects ever conceived. Grill Flame was just one. Another was code-named <a id="filepos508377"></a>Sleeping Beauty; it was a Defense Department study of remote microwave mind-influencing techniques, spurred—as always—by fears that the Soviets were working on the same technology. Vorona was politically daring, but with a spreading network of support in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, he had the power to be daring. Ingo Swann would call him “the super god in the sky over us.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">If Vorona was Grill Flame’s super god in the sky, Pat Price was its Elvis. In one remote-viewing session at Fort Meade in the late 1970s, Skip Atwater targeted an unwitting Joe McMoneagle against Price, telling him only that the target was a person. McMoneagle, down in his zone, described a man who looked like Price in an underground location, <a id="filepos509218"></a>secretly working for the government. A number of remote viewers came to believe that Price was indeed still alive. The rumor circulated that someone (Puthoff, according to one story, although he denies it) had actually encountered Price in the late 1970s, in a suburban Virginia shopping mall, and Price had walked quickly away, hiding his face. Ingo Swann might have been king of the hill now at SRI, but that hill was haunted.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann’s territory at SRI took up much of the third floor of building 44, the Radio Physics building, where the more sensitive RV work was conducted. Along one corridor he had his windowless gray-cocoon remote-viewing chamber, with cameras and microphones and a table he had designed himself with special shelves underneath, where viewers could store paper and pens. To one side of the chamber was a monitoring room, also known as a “recovery room,” where visitors could watch RV sessions on video screens, and where remote viewers could relax after their labors. The place had couches and chairs and tables, dictionaries and encyclopedias; it looked vaguely like a doctor’s waiting room. On the opposite side of the RV chamber was Swann’s office, cluttered with books and files and memoranda and magazine cuttings.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The <a id="filepos510653"></a>budget for the program at SRI was now between $500,000 and $1 million per year (at least half went for SRI’s “overhead” expenses), and about a dozen people were on the payroll. Russell Targ had his own small contract fiefdoms, and Puthoff had also hired a physicist and computer expert named Ed May, who formed a third locus of psi-related research. But Puthoff ran the overall program, was the only one briefed on the most sensitive operations, and served as a monitor for most operational RV sessions. The on-site government representative, DIA’s Jim Salyer, was also trained as a monitor, and had his own office in a temporary trailer just outside the RV lab’s building. When <a id="filepos511375"></a>operational taskings came in, they came in through Salyer, <a id="filepos511442"></a>usually by courier or by secure fax or telephone. He often played the role that Scotty Watt did at Fort Meade, interfacing with clients while Puthoff (like Skip Atwater) ran the remote viewers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For operational tasks, especially when Ingo Swann was the viewer, there were “calibration” targets before and after the main session. The feedback on these practice targets was immediately available. Swann had the idea that he could roughly gauge, from his accuracy in the calibration sessions, what his accuracy had been in the operational session. Calibration targets were called Class C targets, operational targets were Class B, and pure practice targets Class A.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Class B targets were also known as “sexy” targets, but <em class="calibre4">sexy</em> was not always the most appropriate term. SRF’s taskers were often people whose job it was to cover the strangest and potentially most horrible military technologies of the Cold War. During one session against a target inside the Soviet Union, Swann started describing a hallway inside a building. There were green tiles on the walls, and signs that appeared to be in Cyrillic. People wore hospital-type gowns. Swann decided it was a biological-weapons research facility. Another time he found himself in a forest in central Europe. A set of well-guarded buildings lay before him. It looked like a gulag-style prison camp. Swann went down into one of the buildings, and found more biological-weapons research going on, involving not only animals—dogs, pigs, monkeys—but also humans, prisoners taken from the camp. Swann was so distraught at all this that he began crying uncontrollably, and Puthoff had to end the session. Swann later went out and had a few drinks to steady his nerves. The dramatic description of the target was never confirmed by the Pentagon, and the presence of <a id="filepos513457"></a>human subjects seems unlikely, but the description of the site did bear certain similarities to a biological research facility at <a id="filepos513595"></a>Obolensk, in a pine forest south of Moscow—where, it was <a id="filepos513667"></a>revealed years later, at least animals had been exposed to lethal germ agents.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann and others were targeted against biological research or production sites not only at Obolensk, but at Stepnogorsk, Berdsk, an island in the Aral Sea called Vozrozhdeniye, and the city of Sverdlovsk, where a military accident involving spores of the anthrax bacterium had killed hundreds of civilians in 1979. Although it may have had little to do with the data provided by remote viewers, the DIA and the CIA by the mid-1980s would assemble a lengthy list of these Soviet sites, each of which contravened a 1972 treaty banning research towards the offensive use of biological weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The remote viewers at SRI—particularly Gary Lang-ford—also contributed to a number of operations simultaneously tasked to the Army’s remote viewers at Fort Meade. Langford’s sketches and descriptions of the massive <a id="filepos514732"></a><em class="calibre4">Typhoon</em> submarine at Severodvinsk in 1979 substantially matched what Joe McMoneagle produced at Fort Meade, and helped convince Jake Stewart and others in the National Security Council to take the information seriously. Langford and Swann also remote-viewed the failed Chinese nuclear test that year; Langford accurately described an explosion but nothing nuclear—while Swann, alas, veered into a vivid but erroneous description of a premature nuclear blast that had killed thousands of Chinese scientists.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Langford, Swann, and the others targeted Soviet submarines while they were submerged and under way. Among other things, they were asked to spy on particular grooves in mountain ranges beneath the Atlantic, to find out whether Soviet “boomers”—ICBM-launching submarines—were hiding there. Swann and Langford were also asked to participate in the mysterious, urgent operation to recover a lost NATO nuclear weapon near Spain, around 1980.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a id="filepos515960"></a>One day early in 1979, Dale Graff at Wright-Patterson telephoned Hal Puthoff and told him about a possible opportunity that had arisen. The Air Force, he said, was backing a massive multibillion-dollar project. It was a project that depended entirely on security, but remote viewing was just the thing that might be able to defeat that security. If they could prove that, they might get some serious high-level attention. And RV might quickly be catapulted into the mainstream of intelligence-gathering technology.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Air Force program involved a new intercontinental ballistic missile, known as MX. The plan was that the MX would be specially based, in such a way as to evade a nuclear Pearl Harbor, a Soviet “first strike” that would destroy the entire land-based U.S. missile force.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Older generations of land-based ICBMs in the United States had simply been based in silos dug into the ground and surrounded by yards of steel and concrete. If the Soviets sent a first strike, the old reasoning went, their missiles wouldn’t be accurate enough to knock out all these hardened U.S. silos, and thus the United States would have a substantial “counterstrike” capability. But newer intelligence suggested that Soviet ICBMs were becoming much more accurate; American missiles based in fixed silos would soon be vulnerable to direct hits from a first strike. Air Force officials, who believed they had to plan for the worst possible scenario, began to argue that the United States needed a new missile, one mobile enough to evade a Soviet first strike, but not so mobile that it lost its own accuracy.<a id="filepos517745" href="#filepos525679">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">By 1979 the Air Force was backing a kind of shell game scheme in which each MX missile would be shuttled along a special railroad corridor, roughly thirty miles long, with twenty-three “garages” along the way, spaced a mile and a</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>half apart. The MX’s special covered carrier vehicle would constantly shuttle randomly from one garage to the other, inserting the missile in the garage, or seeming to do so. Soviet strike planners, to be sure of hitting the one missile along this track, would have to target all twenty-three garages, which in nuclear-war logic meant two first-strike warheads per garage, or forty-six Soviet warheads to kill one U.S. missile. And in all there would be 200 MX missiles, based on 200 of these linear shell game tracks, spread out in the deserts of Utah and Nevada, so the Soviets would have to use up at least 9,200 warheads just to be sure of wiping out the entire MX force. (And they would still have to deal somehow with American bomber- and submarine-based nuclear weapons.) This kind of math, the Air Force hoped, would deter the Soviets from making a first strike.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Aside from the enormous cost, and the huge political opposition from citizens in Utah and Nevada, the MX scheme seemed airtight. But the Air Force wanted to be sure. It had set up a team at Norton Air Force Base in California, tasked with finding if there was a way, however obscure, by which the Soviets might defeat the scheme.<a id="filepos519473" href="#filepos525986">*</a> Dale Graff suggested that Puthoff should brief the team at Norton about remote viewing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff, it turned out, had just the experiment to brief them on. Charles Tart, a parapsychologist at the University of California at Davis, had recently done a mass psi-ability screening experiment, with funds from the SRI program. He had begun with a basic ESP-card test, screening 2,000 students, graduate students, and faculty for those who had high scores. After another round of screening with a computer</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>ESP test, Tart isolated the ten best subjects, and ran them through a lengthy, final experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">This final experiment essentially involved a computer simulation of a shell game, with ten shells to choose from. For each run the computer randomly rearranged the apparent order of the shells (keeping track of which shell was which), and the subject had to guess which one held the marble. After a number of guesses for the same (constantly rearranged) set of shells, it was hoped, a single shell number would emerge from the statistical noise as the one the subject had chosen most often—and therefore the one most likely to harbor the marble. It was an error-correction strategy, like those used by Czech and Soviet parapsychologists since the 1960s. It essentially took whatever statistical advantage had been bestowed by psi, and amplified it. Tart gave each subject twenty-five guesses per run.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">If pure, random chance had been the only thing at work, then each subject would have guessed the correct shell only about 10 percent of the time. There would be no benefit from error correction, because there would be no statistical advantage to amplify. No matter how many runs and rearrangements were performed, the accuracy rate would always average out to 10 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It turned out that Tart’s best performer, a woman named Mary Long, was much better than chance would have predicted. For any given one-out-of-ten guess, she had not a 10 percent chance of being right but a 25 percent chance of being right. With his error-correction strategy, Tart was easily able to boost that advantage. Analyzing Mary Long’s twenty-five guesses per run, he was able to determine the shell that held the marble each time, for twenty separate shell-game runs in a row. The odds against such a result happening by chance were absurdly large.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff took Tart’s results and wrote them up in a lengthy report, redoing the math to fit the MX problem. He calculated that at Mary Long’s average hit rate, she would <a></a>find the hidden MX—with an accuracy of 80 percent—within only fifty guesses. In other words, it would take Mary Long, or a small team of remote viewers as good as she, only a few hours to defeat a scheme on which the Pentagon was willing to spend many billions of taxpayers’ dollars.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At Norton Air Force Base there was a certain amount of unease over Puthoff’s report, and it was forwarded to the MX project office at the Pentagon. But the Air Force, which jealously guarded the MX shell-game scheme, seemed to ignore the remote-viewing report. Still, Puthoff wasn’t ready to give up. With help from Dale Graff, he decided to go around the Air Force, and briefed the MX results to Jake Stewart at the National Security Council, who then circulated the report to other Carter administration officials.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Some officials simply refused to accept the idea that psychics could have an impact in such weighty strategic matters. Others were more impressed, though in the end, the SRI report probably did not have a major influence on the ultimate MX decision, which was left by President Carter to his successor, Ronald Reagan.<a id="filepos523802" href="#filepos526422">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Even so, the remote-viewing proponents had left their mark. Unfortunately, instead of attracting sympathy and funding to the RV program, they had incurred the wrath of the Air Force brass. In 1980, Dale Graff applied for and won a fellowship for “exceptional analysts” within the intelligence community. The fellowship normally enabled a recipient to spend two years conducting sabbatical-type research in other laboratories. Graff planned to spend the <a></a>two years at four labs: SRI in California, a psychokinesis-oriented research laboratory at Princeton University, a J. B. Rhine-affiliated psi lab in Durham, North Carolina, and even a Department of Energy lab where microwave weapons technologies were being studied. Graff was about to get on a plane to Washington, for the award ceremonies at CIA headquarters, when he received a phone call. He was told that he would not be receiving the fellowship, and would not be spending two years visiting psi laboratories. The office of the Air Force Chief of Staff had taken the apparently unprecedented step of revoking Graff’s award.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Graff’s career at Wright-Patterson was now clearly over. Fortunately he could turn to Jack Vorona, the super god in the sky. With Vorona’s encouragement, he soon resigned from Wright-Pat, shook the dust of the Air Force from his feet, and joined Vorona’s group at the DIA.</p>

<p id="filepos526422" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos523802">*</a> In 1983 Reagan decided to abandon the Air Force’s shell-game scheme, probably for budgetary and political reasons more than anything else. He obtained funding from Congress for one hundred MX “Peacekeeper” missiles, and fifty were eventually built. Although the Bush administration later considered basing the missiles in special rail cars on railroads around the western United States, the missiles ended up in old, fixed Minuteman ICBM silos at Warren AFB in Wyoming and Colorado.</p>
