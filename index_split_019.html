<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">U</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">RI</span></span> G<span><span class="calibre13">ELLER IS AT THE WHEEL OF THE CAR, DRIVING THROUGH A</span></span> residential section near Menlo Park. He is wearing a blindfold. An <em class="calibre4">Apollo 14</em> astronaut, Edgar Mitchell, who walked on the moon only two years ago, is in the front passenger seat. It’s not a dream. It’s real, and Hal Puthoff is there in the backseat, bracing himself for a crash, and meanwhile Geller navigates, supposedly through ESP, and describes all the scenery just to let everyone know that, despite the blindfold, he’s still in control.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">That car that just passed us is red!</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Okay, Uri …</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Stop sign!</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Uri, that’s enough, now.…</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There is a nice house over there.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">You’ve shown us, Uri.…</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Another car—a big one, white.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos295042"></a>Okay, you got it, Uri. Now.…</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And Puthoff is thinking that this is a hell of a way for Geller to inaugurate a serious scientific investigation—with the blindfolded-driving routine, an old stage-magician’s trick.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Uri Geller, just arrived from Israel and fast becoming an international celebrity, had first visited SRI in the fall of 1972. Puthoff and Targ had wanted to test him. Ken Kress and Richard Kennett and others at the CIA, looking quietly over the SRI researchers’ shoulders, had also wanted to get a look at the controversial Israeli wonder-worker.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For the first full year of their psi research at SRI, Puthoff and Targ therefore performed a kind of juggling act, coaxing the flamboyant Israeli into the lab when neither Price nor Swann was there, trying—not very successfully, in the case of Swann vs. Geller—to keep the rivalries and resentments under control.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The first visit was arranged through Geller’s minder, a neurologist, inventor, and psi enthusiast named Andrija Puharich. He warned Puthoff and his colleagues that studying the young Israeli wouldn’t be too easy. Uri seemed spooked by the prospect of being stuck in a laboratory environment. He needed room to breathe, to move. According to Puharich, Geller also believed himself to be some kind of space-age prophet; specifically, he claimed that his powers came from a huge flying saucer-shaped computer, “Spectra,” somewhere out there in Earth’s gravitational field. Spectra was in turn controlled by a distant, bureaucratic entity named Hoova, a sort of ethereal governor of planet Earth.<a id="filepos296977" href="#filepos318970">*</a> Hey, whatever, shrugged Puthoff and Targ.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">So Geller came to SRI, and drove blindfolded. He bent <a id="filepos297198"></a>or broke spoons and rings and various other metal items. He seemed to remotely reduce the weight of a one-gram object on an electronic scale. He described simple sketches locked in briefcases. He apparently scrambled the electronic innards of an SRI magnetometer’s strip chart recorder, and somehow, from a distance of several feet, caused the image on a video screen to shift.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It should have been mind-blowing stuff, but Geller’s style was so hyperkinetic, so chaotic, as if designed to misdirect the eye, that Puthoff and Targ usually suspected sleight of hand. The young Israeli was like a walking stage magician, and a very good one—although for some feats, the answer was almost too obvious, like that blindfolded-driving trick. Puthoff and Targ believed that Geller could have accomplished it simply by looking through the gap, which is always there, between blindfold and nose.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Geller was born on the winter solstice of 1946, in Tel Aviv, of Hungarian emigré parents. Playing in his parents’ garden at the age of four, according to the Geller legend, he was visited by a strange luminous apparition—the Joan of Arc motif again—and thereafter began to manifest paranormal talents. Unlike Swann and Price, he did not have out-of-body experiences or premonitions; instead he is said to have been able to read minds, to visualize hidden objects and drawings clairvoyantly, and to bend small pieces of metal.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When Geller was ten, his parents separated, and he went to live with his mother on the island of Cyprus. At the age of seventeen, he returned to Israel, entered military service, joined the paratroops, and was wounded during the Six-Day War in 1967.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After he recuperated, he put his good looks to work, appearing as a model in advertisements for shaving cream and other consumer products. Encouraged by a friend named Shipi Strang, he put on his first public performance <a id="filepos299423"></a>of mind reading and metal-bending in a Tel Aviv school hall in 1969. More public performances followed, and through the connections of a girlfriend who worked in advertising, he also became a performer at private parties throughout Israel. As time went by, the partygoers seemed to become more prestigious, and one day he found himself doing his routine for Prime Minister Golda Meir. Shortly thereafter, in response to a reporter’s question about the future of Israel, Meir remarked, “I don’t know—ask Uri Geller.” Already moderately well known, Geller now became an Israeli household word.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the middle of 1970 the reaction had begun, and skeptics in Israel were attacking him loudly. Some illustrated their arguments by apparently duplicating his feats with ordinary sleight-of-hand tricks. Others made specific allegations of cheating. But already, it seemed, Geller’s celebrity was beyond the reach of the skeptics. He seemed to be moving in higher circles, where his supporters included key officials of the Israeli government. According to his own account, Geller one evening was invited to dinner at a steakhouse near Tel Aviv by General Moshe Dayan, hero of the Six-Day War. Dayan wanted to know whether the psychic was genuine. Geller obliged him, bending a key and doing some successful ESP demonstrations, even having Dayan act as a telepathic receiver of information. Later Dayan invited Geller to his house, and asked him to find a photograph he had hidden somewhere in his study. Geller eventually pointed out a book on a shelf, and described the photograph as the flag of Israel. Laughing, Dayan turned to page 201 of the book, and showed Geller the target: a photo of the main tower of Tel Aviv’s Lod Airport, atop which the Israeli flag was flying. “You’ve proved yourself, Uri,” Geller says Dayan remarked. “I don’t want to see any more. There’s no need for you to bend anything. Now, what can you do for Israel?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Geller, so the story goes, went on to meet with military <a></a>intelligence chief Aharon Yariv,<a id="filepos301704" href="#filepos319188">*</a> as well as with officials of Mossad (roughly, the Israeli CIA) and Shin Bet (the Israeli FBI). He was tested by these agencies, and began to work for them. He became a modern-day version of the Israeli prophet <a id="filepos301967"></a>Elisha, whose legendary exploits are recounted in the Old Testament:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">And the man of God [Elisha] sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">Some things never change. Geller’s attempted tasks allegedly included the clairvoyant viewing of intelligence targets in Syria and other countries in the Middle East, the prediction of hostile troop deployments, and even the telepathic influencing of various Arab figures. But to the chagrin of the Israeli government (he would later say) he decided that he would rather pursue a high-profile career as a stage performer than a zero-profile career as a psychic <a id="filepos303937"></a>warrior. In 1972, Geller was enticed to America by Andrija Puharich, who funded the visit with a grant from the Institute of Noetic Science, run by former astronaut Edgar Mitchell, a psi enthusiast.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Rumors soon spread that the Soviets were interested in Geller and his feats, and were actually following him around the United States. Whether or not the rumors were true, some CIA officials were certainly interested. They made clear to Puthoff that they wanted to know whether the Israeli psychic was for real, and if he was, how valuable an intelligence asset he could be, to whoever might employ him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And if he <em class="calibre4">wasn’t</em> for real, the Agency wanted to know how he managed to look real. There were <a id="filepos304801"></a>wild surmises in the air. Perhaps Geller was some sort of bionic man, with magnetic implants that enabled him to stop watches, shift television screens, spin compasses, tickle magnetometers, and so forth. Perhaps he had radio receivers—for communicating with secret confederates—implanted in his inner ears, or in his teeth. Perhaps he was part of some Mossad disinformation project, designed to spook the Arabs into believing that Israel possessed a paranormal superman. Or perhaps Israeli intelligence wanted to use him to infiltrate SRI, to spy on America’s most sensitive psychic research.<a id="filepos305423" href="#filepos319465">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">To complicate the picture, several Israeli officials turned up at SRI one day in the summer of 1973. Puthoff had the impression that they were from Israeli military intelligence. Whoever they were, they proceeded to explain, in deliberately vague terms, that Geller had done some surprisingly <a id="filepos305841"></a>good work for them against Middle Eastern military targets. The officials said they wanted to know: Was this just amazing luck, or did Geller have actual psychic talents that could be verified by scientific experimentation? Perhaps Puthoff, as a reputable scientist performing controlled experiments, could help them determine what was what. But the Israelis and their questions only made Puthoff and his colleagues more paranoid.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In all, Geller made several visits to SRI. Some were high-profile, and some were never reported, but most followed the same pattern. In some tests, there seemed no room for doubt that his psi abilities were genuine, while in other tests, he seemed to do no more than a stage magician could.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">His stay in August of 1973 was fairly typical. To start with, Geller was put in an electromagnetically shielded room. Sealed inside with a pen and blank paper, he was asked to reproduce drawings of objects chosen by Puthoff. The scientist would choose targets by arbitrarily selecting a page from a dictionary and finding the first drawable word. In the first test, Puthoff selected the word <em class="calibre4">fuse</em>, then had an SRI artist quietly sketch a fuse and firecracker. Puthoff taped the sketch to the wall outside the shielded room. Geller was told via intercom to start concentrating. Within a few seconds he said, “I see a cylinder with noise coming out of it,” although none of his eventual sketches—which included a giraffe, a snare drum, and a long-necked human with a stringlike thing coming out of one ear—was absolutely on target. His next attempt, however, couldn’t have been more accurate. The SRI artist drew a bunch of grapes—twenty-four, to be exact—and inside the shielded room Geller began to talk about “drops of water coming out of the picture,” and “purple circles,” before sketching a bunch of precisely twenty-four grapes, to the same scale as the SRI artist’s drawing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos308059"></a>It went on like this for various types of experiment. Sometimes Geller would be tested for clairvoyance, the target drawing being left on an unattended computer screen, or on a computer disc, or sealed inside a shielded room. Sometimes the experiment would be set up to test telepathy, and the target drawing would be watched by someone such as Puthoff, or his SRI division chief, Bart Cox. Geller didn’t always describe the targets perfectly, but he did so often enough to suggest to Puthoff and others at SRI that he had some genuine ability. “He was wonderful, not just all right,” Ingo Swann would later say, in a rare concession to one of his great rivals.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">With Geller’s trademark talent, psychokinesis, the story was somewhat different. Puthoff and Targ would later seem to duplicate many of the psychic’s metal-bending or machine-altering demonstrations with mundane magician’s tricks. And Geller’s psychokinetic displays never occurred under controlled conditions. He would stand for hours in a room, covered by video cameras from several angles, but it seemed that the spoons, bars, and rings over which he hovered would bend only when he was allowed to handle them over long periods, or when the monitoring cameras momentarily ran out of videotape. And when his only monitors were unaided humans, he seemed always in motion, keeping up a patter, using his voice and body language—his audience thought—to divert attention while his eyes looked patiently for the magician’s enchanted window of opportunity. Outside the laboratory, at lunch in the SRI dining room for instance, one had only to turn one’s attention from him for a second, and he would suddenly produce, bent into a loop, the fork that had just been nestling beside one’s plate.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A story later made the rounds, to the effect that Geller had been videotaped performing a sleight-of-hand trick during a metal-bending attempt. Swann even claimed that he had urged the scrutiny of the tape that had revealed the <a id="filepos310274"></a>trick. Puthoff and Targ denied the existence of any such smoking gun, but it was clear that they were on guard against magician’s tricks. Once or twice, they put the experienced stage magician Milbourne Christopher into the laboratory during experiments, disguised as a camera-wielding lab technician. On a few other occasions, after Geller had left for the day, Puthoff and Targ searched the laboratory rafters and acoustic tiles for hidden audio or video bugs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">They never found anything.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">And so the essential question persisted: Was Geller a psychic or wasn’t he? He had come up with remarkable results in tests that seemed to have been reasonably well controlled. How could one reconcile such results with his tricksterish demeanor? Was he a shamanic savant, or a clever illusionist?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Or was such a strong distinction realistic? For the tales of shamans and other visionaries, throughout history and across cultures, contained a striking number of references to the development of sleight-of-hand skills, and to the manifestation of an incorrigibly childlike trickiness, all this intermingled with apparently “genuine” skills and beliefs. “The elementary <a id="filepos311688"></a>mythology of shamanism,” wrote Joseph Campbell in his <em class="calibre4">Historical Atlas of World Mythology</em>, “is neither of truth and falsehood nor of good and evil, but of degrees of power: power achieved by breaking through the walls of space and barriers of time to sources unavailable to others. Shamanic combat is but one manifestation of this interest. The use of magical tricks and deceptions to impress and intimidate the uninitiated represents another.” Campbell gave as example an Eskimo shaman who had been interviewed in the 1920s by the anthropologist Knud Rasmussen:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21"><a id="filepos312396"></a><a id="filepos312404"></a>Najagneq, for example, had frequently employed deceptions to protect himself from his neighbors by playing on their superstitions, and he was not afraid to admit that he had made an art of pulling their legs. But when Rasmussen asked if he really believed in all the powers to which he pretended, he replied: “Yes, a power that we call Sila, one that cannot be explained in so many words.…”</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">On occasion the leg-pulling of the shamans seemed to serve an even more interesting purpose, according to Campbell, who wrote that the effects of the shaman’s “<a id="filepos313114"></a>mystifications, theatrical scenes, and sleight-of-hand illusionism … turn back on the mind of the shaman himself and become the aids and generators of his own translation to ecstasy.” Which was another way of saying that the shaman sometimes bootstrapped himself into an altered state with his own stage-magic tricks, as if his right brain didn’t know what his left was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In fact, tricksterish themes are found not just in shamanism, but throughout the psi lore, from mystics to mediums. The psychologist Carl Jung, remarking on this connection, named “the Trickster” one of the four great archetypes of the human psyche.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Whether he was a shamanic trickster or not, Geller was certainly an enigma to some, although most seem to have decided that he was completely genuine, or just a very skilled showman. Puthoff and Targ remained reasonably open-minded, but even so they eventually gave up on him; Geller simply attracted too much <a id="filepos314252"></a>heat from skeptics inside and outside the thinktank. He didn’t seem to be worth the trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Pentagon’s <a id="filepos314454"></a>Advanced Research Projects Agency, which sent a three-man team to look at Geller at SRI in early 1973, came to the same conclusion—although one member of the ARPA team, University of Virginia psychologist <a id="filepos314674"></a>Robert Van de Castle, seemed reasonably impressed, and would have liked to see further investigations of the young Israeli.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As for the CIA, corporately it didn’t seem to have an opinion. SRI was never given money explicitly for the purpose of studying Geller. And yet some at the Agency were deeply impressed by Geller, and would long remain puzzled by him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day, during one of Geller’s visits to SRI, Puthoff telephoned Richard <a id="filepos315272"></a>Kennett at his office at CIA headquarters, and they conducted an informal experiment. Kennett was to select a target, and Geller, standing beside Puthoff out at SRI, would try to describe it. All right, said Kennett, who went over to his bookshelf, took out <em class="calibre4">Gray’s Anatomy</em>, and turned to a glossy overlay page depicting the architecture of the human brain. He told Puthoff he was ready, and Puthoff relayed the word to Geller. The psychic began to concentrate. He said he was having trouble with this one. “I don’t know what to say … it’s like a blob of scrambled eggs … or like a brain … or something to do with architecture.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Geller did even better on another occasion, a hot Saturday afternoon late in the summer of 1973. This time Kennett, working from his home in suburban Virginia, chose several numbers, sealed them in an envelope, put the envelope in his den, and then sat down by the phone to concentrate on them. Geller was on the other end of the line, while Puthoff stood by. Kennett had hardly begun to concentrate when Geller said, “Oh my God, something has happened! Rick, go find out what has happened!”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett asked him what the hell this was all about, and Geller explained that something dramatic had just occurred in Kennett’s house. “Rick, please believe me,” he said, “I’ve got this terrible feeling of glass slivers and shards slicing through my body. I’m seeing this picture of this sea of green, smooth green. And in the middle of the green, <a id="filepos317055"></a>there’s a strange-looking dog with a square face. He’s all white, but he’s got blood on his neck and down his chin.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett went back to his den and saw that his white bulldog, who wore a blood-red macramé collar with a tassel, had run into the room moments before, knocking over a tall lamp with a glass globe on top. The globe had shattered, and shards of white glass lay all over the green carpet.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">A few years after Geller left SRI, when he was living in Mexico, members of the CIA’s Mexico City station apparently made use of him, in return giving him favorable U.S. visa arrangements. According to Geller, he tried to psychically spy on local Soviet case officers, their agents, and the dead-drop sites they used. Through his social connections, he also apparently tried to convince senior Mexican officials to reduce the bloated KGB presence in the Soviets’ Mexico City embassy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Geller eventually left Mexico in a hurry, after a British tabloid linked him romantically (they were just friends, Geller protested) to the wife of Mexican President José Lopez-Portillo. Afterwards, Geller claimed, he did psychic detective work for the FBI in New York. He also continued his stage career, and did some apparently lucrative psychic tasks for oil and mining companies in South America and the western Pacific. In the 1980s, he would settle in England, in an enormous house on the banks of the Thames. When people asked him, “If you’re so psychic, why aren’t you rich?” he would laugh and say—“I <em class="calibre4">am</em> rich.”</p>
<div border="1" class="calibre_24"><div class="calibre3">
<p id="filepos318970" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos296977">*</a> Geller disavowed these beliefs years later, blaming them on regression hypnosis sessions Puharich had performed on him.</p>
<p id="filepos319188" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos301704">*</a> In an interview with science writer John Wilhelm in the mid-1970s, Yariv denied ever meeting or consulting with Geller (but then, he <em class="calibre4">would</em> say that, wouldn’t he?)</p>
<p id="filepos319465" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos305423">*</a> Geller says that he met secretly, in hotel rooms in the United States, with a group of Israeli officials to brief them in detail about his experiences at SRI. According to Geller, the same officials warned him “not to do certain things” at SRI, things that Geller won’t specify. Puthoff says he was never told by Geller about these contacts, but as Geller recalls, the SRI physicist did keep him from getting too close to the experiments with Swann and Price.</p>
