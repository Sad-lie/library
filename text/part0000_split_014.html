   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">To the immediate right of the clef, before the time signature, on each line of the staff is placed the key signature. The key signature determines how the seven notes marked by the staff are altered in order to create whatever scale the piece of music is written in. In the case of C major or A minor key (as on figure 1.1.2), no alteration is needed to those notes, and so the key signature space is empty, but for every other key, diatonic or otherwise, the seven notes of that key can be thought of as alterations to the seven notes of C major, and so determining and notating the key of the music is as simple as placing sharps or flats on the staff lines themselves. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This is the key signature – some arrangement of sharps or flats (in diatonic keys it is always one or the other), in general ranging from one to six alterations (6 sharps/flats, but sometimes more). The key signatures themselves are standardized, so that, for instance, Bb major is always written down the same way (this allows the instrumentalist to quickly recognize the key of the song after having memorized each key signature). More will be said on key signatures in a later section.</span> </p>
