   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The notes of the staff, in any key, are by nature diatonic. They are the notes of some major scale (or of some relative minor scale). Even though the keys change, the relationships between the notes in those keys do not change. For the sake of convenience, musicians and composers have developed a way to represent those relationships quickly and easily. The solfege system is that representational method. It is a linguistic model of the diatonic major scale, with each vowel representing one distinct note in the scale. This is an old system, and it is familiar to most of us from grade school—the vowels of the solfege system (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do) are easily and immediately recognizable, and most all of us have an intuitive understanding of the harmonic relationships between those vowels. This linguistic system is used to teach singing and sightreading by helping people relate the sounds of the major scale to the pitches as they are represented on the page in some diatonic key. </span> </p>
