   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The final piece of information that is immediately given to the performer on a sheet of music is the piece’s tempo. Historically, this was communicated with written words—often in Italian—such as “allegro” and “vivace,” but it is common in contemporary music, and particularly in pop and jazz, for a sheet to simply note the precise tempo numerically (setting the value of a quarter note to, for instance, 80 or 120, which means that there are that many quarter notes in a minute). </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Setting the beats per minute, or BPM, of a piece reduces any confusion about the exact pace at which the piece is meant to be played, although it is still customary in some compositional practices to use the old classical terms. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The tempo is not listed on the bar in the way that the clef, key signature, and time signature are, and it does not get listed more than once (it is not repeated with each new line) unless the tempo of the piece changes in course (in which case the tempo change is marked at the location of that change). Instead of being notated on the staff itself, the words or numerical value is listed, at the beginning of the piece, above the staff on the left side of the page.</span> </p>
