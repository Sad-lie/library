   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Traditional solfege has its advantages, but musicians in the contemporary non-classical tradition quickly recognized its shortcomings. While traditional solfege makes conceptualizing the notes of the unaltered staff (in C major) easy, and therefore encourages quick sightreading and sight-singing in C (or a relative key), it makes it difficult to “hear” other scales (even other major scales) as easily.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">For that reason, the jazz tradition most often uses a solfege system in which “Do” is moveable—whatever the root note of the scale you are using (or the first note of the closest relative major scale), that is “Do.” In this way, thinking of and hearing (and so singing) any scale in any key is a relatively easy matter, and sightreading or sight-singing in any key becomes easy—all you need to sing any major scale, for instance, regardless of how complicated the key signature, is to be provided with a reference “Do.” This encourages not perfect pitch but relative pitch, which is in some cases more important and more useful – since everything in music is, essentially, relative.</span> </p>
