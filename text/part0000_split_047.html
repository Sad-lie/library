   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The hardest thing about reading music, perhaps the hardest thing about learning to think about music in general, is to develop fluency. It is easy enough to memorize the structures: When we talk about harmony, for instance, we are really only talking about a handful of different chords and scales that fit together in a handful of predictable ways. When we talk about sightreading or notating musical concepts, we are similarly only talking about a small number of basic forms—fundamental units, building blocks, the discrete objects that make up the score (signatures, clefs, notes, accidentals, and a few other markers that notate dynamics and inflections).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">But music is not made of discrete objects. Music is continuous. It is the art of time—of movement and sequence rather than of simultaneity, of pure continuity rather than discreteness. That makes it hard to go from the relatively small number of objects that can be quickly memorized to the infinitely variable continuity of fluid sounds (and their representations on the page of a score). The hard thing is to be able to think and to read not as though you were dealing with units but as though you were plunging your mind and your body into a stream.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">There isn’t, unfortunately, any shortcut to gaining that kind of fluency. Not really. But there is a basic procedure when it comes to reading notes on a staff (just as there are procedures for assembling harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic structures on your instrument). </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">The idea is this: </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">1. You begin by identifying the key of the song (by looking at the key signature) and that helps you to identify the scale in which the song is being played. You know, just from that, that any notes on the staff that aren’t accidentals will be one of the seven notes in the scale you have identified. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">2. It is then a matter of orienting your instrument to the staff. You find the root of the scale on your instrument and find that same note on the staff, and then as you read the notes on the staff you move up or down the scale as needed. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">That limits what you have to think about to one pattern—the scale that the song is written in—in only a few (or perhaps one) positions on your instrument. It is easy enough to see that if the note on the page is two scale degrees higher than the last one, then you have to play the note on your instrument that is two scale degrees higher than the one you just played. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">In time, you will begin to be able to recognize whole sequences at once (rather than seeing each note separately). The other five notes, the ones not contained in that scale, will be indicated by accidentals, and they can be seen as modifications up or down in pitch (by one or two half steps) of one of the notes in the scale you are already playing. In this way, most melodies written in most songs can be played easily.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">In the case of those songs with more complex harmony where the key center changes without a new key being notated, there will be a scale used to compose the notes on the staff that doesn’t match up with the scale you have identified on your instrument. You can either recognize that new scale (which is one of those things that takes time to learn to do) and adjust your playing momentarily, or you can see each note of the new scale (some of which will be accidentals) as alterations of the scale that you have already identified. This second approach is suited to some jazz songs in which there are multiple but brief new key centers that are different from the key of the song.</span> </p>
