   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">To the right of the key signature on the staff is the time signature. This tells the musician how to count the beat of the music, and it also determines how many notes and rests of a particular rhythmic value fit into a bar of music – a bar being the fundamental unit of time in music, the length of which is determined by the time signature. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The time signature is expressed as a ratio—one number on top and another on the bottom (see fig. 1.1.2.). There will be more to say about time signatures and their variety in a dedicated section, but for now it is enough to note that it is given to the right of the key signature at the beginning of the piece (and whenever it changes) and that it is a ratio – a ratio, without getting fully into detail just now, that expresses the count (on the number on top) of some rhythmic value (the number on bottom) that goes into each bar. For example, the 4/4 time signature simply reads as four quarter notes in one bar, 6/8 would be six eight notes in one bar, and so on.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The time signature, like the key signature, can be changed during a piece of music, and when it is changed the new signature is inserted at the beginning of whatever bar the change occurs at.</span> </p>
