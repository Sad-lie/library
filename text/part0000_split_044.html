   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Knowing the parts of the staff—knowing what it is you’re looking at when you’re looking at a sheet of music—is only part of the battle. Learning to read and write music, even if your goal is not absolute fluency, requires more than learning the parts in abstraction. Parts of speech never add up to a language, and written music is a language; you can know all of the basic units, how they work together, and what everything is supposed to be telling you, but until you know how to make a message out of that collection, until you know how to make continuous sense out of discrete parts, you will not have learned the language.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Music is more than rule-governed sounds, and so too is written music more than syntactic units. To understand the language you have to have an ear for the tongue in which it is spoken. In part, that means you have to be a musician—the better you are as a musician, the better your ear is, the more in tune you are with the structures of musical composition, the more thorough your understanding will be and so the easier it will be to translate a written page into something that sounds like the music you are used to hearing and making. Having an ear for the tongue also means learning to immerse yourself in the written language of music, to express it as a sound or an idea without having to translate it. You don’t translate your mother tongue, and neither should you need to translate written music.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Paradoxically, the process of learning how not to translate (by doing lots of translating) is long, and for some of us it is never-ending (particularly if we are coming to written music late in life) but it is possible to be guided and to guide yourself toward a more efficient way of reading the music that you see on the page—there are tricks of the mind, good habits, that will help you to get from those foreign-looking notes to your hands or vocal chords (or the other way around). You may even begin thinking with the writing itself, in terms of the page and not always of the instrument (directly from the sound to the staff or vice versa). That, at least, is the goal.</span> </p>
