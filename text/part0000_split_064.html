   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Before the main text of this book is closed, let me offer some words of advice on practice. Practice is not distinct from performance. Practice is not what you do before you play, before you compose. Practice is already a kind of playing. It is already improvising. It is already performing. It is already composing. To practice well means to practice with joy and lightness, just as you would aim to perform or record. If you can practice that way, then not only will learning to sightread be more fun, it will work better. You will be more likely to put in the kind of time you need to put in if you are truly, deeply enjoying yourself (and if you see yourself as making music and not merely getting ready to make music). Build sightreading practice into your daily musical routine, just as you would build in playing scales. Don’t try to do it all at once – that way lies frustration – simply spend time, each day, even if it is five or ten minutes, learning to understand the written word of sound. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">There are three things to remember when you’re beginning a practice routine: </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">(i) Go slow </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">(ii) Practice in small chunks</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">(iii) Take breaks. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre13">(i)</span><span class="calibre3"> Ought to be obvious, but it is too often hard to employ. The point is not to go quickly. The point is not to race to reading something long and fast and difficult. The point is to immerse yourself in music, however simple, and benefit from that immersion. If you do that, and if you do it right, then you will feel yourself becoming a better musician very quickly, even in ways you didn’t expect at the beginning. If you rush, however, then you will inevitably be practicing bad habits, and you will be doing yourself a disservice. You will be frustrated, the joy will disappear, and you will neither progress as a sightreader nor as a musician on the whole. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre13">(ii)</span><span class="calibre3"> Is equally as important. By practicing in small chunks of time – 10 to 30 minutes a day – you are building it into your life in a manageable way. It will then become a part of your musicianship, right from the beginning, which will encourage growth immediately. If you take on too much at a time, then you will once again feel the burden of frustration, and you will stop making progress. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre13">(iii)</span><span class="calibre3"> is not always obvious, but it is important nonetheless. Taking breaks is a great way to increase your short-term productivity. It releases, tension, allows you to regroup, and lets you always come at what you’re doing fresh. If you are practicing something for a long time (and 30 minutes is a long time) then you should be taking at least one break. Even if you are only going to practice for 20 minutes a day, then it may benefit you to split it up – 10 minutes at the beginning of your practice and 10 minutes at the end. A good split might have you identifying some manageable thing to work on for that day, running through it a few times (allowing it to feel difficult) and then taking a break, playing as you normally would, returning to your sightreading practice again at the end. You will likely find that what was difficult an hour ago no longer seems as hard. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre66">If you practice the right way – calmly, patiently, correctly, and with joy – then you will begin to feel the benefit of that practice virtually immediately. It will be easier to think about and talk about music. It will be easier to learn songs. It will all seem a little clearer. Eventually, you will be able to sightread fluently.</span> </p>
