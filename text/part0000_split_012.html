   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">A final note on the lines of the staff: It may already be clear that these notes -- from E above middle C to the F of the next octave – are not enough. They aren't enough to notate the full pitch range of an instrument, even one for which treble clef is designed, such as a guitar. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">In order to meet the needs of the full range of an instrument and a composition, it is possible to extend the staff up as well as down. This is done by placing small extension lines, called “</span><span class="calibre36">ledger lines</span><span class="calibre3">”, above or beneath the staff, and using those lines to notate the music that extends (in terms of pitch) below or above the existing staff range. These notes follow the same rules as the notes that fall on a not extended staff – they ascend and descend by single scale degrees. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Extending the staff up or down simply extends the scale that one is writing in thus covering more octaves (the scale – most often diatonic – that is represented by the staff in a certain key will repeat above and below that staff).</span> </p>
