Key Signatures</span><span class="calibre247"></span><span class="calibre248"></span><span class="calibre249"></span><span class="calibre250"></span></a> </h2>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The key signature is written to the right of the clef and to the left of the time signature. It is one of the most important components of a staff, and it is the first thing that many practiced sightreaders look at. The job of the key signature is to tell the performer what key the song is written in. What that means, however, is that its job is to modify the lines of the staff (and the spaces in between) so that the seven notes indicated on the staff match the seven notes of whatever key the song is in.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">For instance: The notes of the staff in treble clef, unmodified, are (from bottom to top) E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. These are the notes of the C major (or A minor) scale. But if the song is written in a different key, for instance F major, then the composer will want the lines of the staff to read: E, F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. To modify the B to Bb in every octave on the staff, the composer simply writes the ‘b’ symbol at the appropriate place on the staff after the clef and before the time signature. This indicates the key signature which instantly tells us what key the song is.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Key signatures do not alter the accidentals written on the staff themselves (there will be more on accidentals later, but in general these are the notes on the staff with sharps and flats written next to them). It does not restrain the composition and prevent the composer from writing, for instance, a Gb in F major. What it does is alter the staff lines themselves, so that if a note is written on the B line in F major it will automatically be a Bb. The use of key signatures helps to de-clutter the written music from the overuse of sharps and flats.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This makes it much easier to notate a piece in a key other than C (even if that piece bends the rules of the key frequently), and it makes it possible to quickly read the lines of music for the performer (since they less frequently have to think about sharping or flattening notes, and since it gives them a seven-note reference, a scale in which to place the notes that are written, rather than having to sort through all 12 tones of the chromatic scale to find each note). The performer gets to use a scale as a guide when reading the sheet, modifying the scale on the fly only when an accidental is present. This is one of the reasons why Major scale (namely C major scale/key) is considered to be the foundation for everything else.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">A key signature consists of nothing more than sharps or flats (not both, and usually only as many as seven of them) written in a particular order, on the staff at the beginning of each line (after the clef). There are some rules however that should be followed while doing this which we’ll examine soon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Recognizing the key is an easy matter—one does not have to sort out exactly which notes are being altered, they only have to count how many alterations there are—there is exactly one key for each number of sharps, and one key for each number of flats (usually up to seven). The number of sharps or flats in a given key, as well as the order in which they are notated at the beginning of each line, is determined by the circle of fifths.</span> </p>
