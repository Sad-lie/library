   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Time signatures are expressed as simple ratios—4/4 being the most common one. The top number always tells you how many notes fit into a bar, while the bottom number always tells you which kind of notes you are talking about (which kind of notes are counted or pulsed according to the top number). The bottom number then has to represent some musical note.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">There will be more on note durations later, but for now we can say that they occur in divisions of two: whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and so on. The bottom number in the time signature’s ratio represents one of these notes—it can be a 2 (half note), a 4 (quarter note), an 8 (eighth note), and so on. It is not possible for the bottom number to be any numbers other than ones that represent actual note durations (you won’t see a 7 in that position in the time signature).</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The top number in the time signature’s ratio instructs us as to how many of the notes identified by the bottom number will fit into a bar. 3/4 time, for instance, tells us that there are three quarter notes in each bar. That means that the pulse of the song is in quarter notes (rather than, for instance, in eighth notes), and it means that there are 3 such pulses in each bar—1, 2, 3…1, 2, 3… (3/4 is a common waltz time). The top number can in theory be any number, since all it is doing is telling you how many notes to fit into a bar.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Taken together with the tempo of a song, the time signature tells you exactly how long a bar is. If the tempo is 120, then that means that there are 120 quarter notes in each minute, which means a quarter note takes half of a second. If the time signature then is 6/8, that means there are six eighth notes in each bar, and since an eighth note is half as long as a quarter note (and thus at 120 bpm it takes a quarter of a second), a bar will consist of six quarter-second pulses, or one and a half seconds. </span> </p>
