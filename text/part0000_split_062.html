   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Every instrument has a distinct technical set. What that means is that for each instrument, there is a range of techniques available to the performer that is distinct for that instrument. A violinist can pluck the strings with their fingers and it will be different than a guitarist doing the same thing. A guitarist can play a false harmonic, something that isn’t possible on a saxophone. A pianist can utilize his or her floor pedals. And so on. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre66">In addition to these standard techniques, there is a range of extended techniques for each instrument. A saxophone player can extend his range upwards, he can howl, he can overblow. A guitarist can mute the strings with her left hand, she can scratch the strings with her pick. All of these techniques, standard and extended, are capable of being notated by a composer. The set of symbols that represents these techniques is different for each instrument, and can vary from composer to composer, but in general they are placed above the staff or above or below the notes on the staff to indicate to the performer how they are meant to play a given sequence.</span> </p>
