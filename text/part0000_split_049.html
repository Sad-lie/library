   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">When jazz composers write their songs, the intention is not to instruct the performer to play in an exact way. There is the head, which consists of a (usually simple) melody and a set of chords (the “changes”) and then that head forms the basis of the improvisations that take place during the song. To this end, jazz composers, as well as many country and rock musicians, write lead sheets. These consist of a melody, often in a single voice, and a set of changes written above that melody to indicate the way the harmony of the song progresses. The performer is often expected to play a lead sheet, and improvise based on the changes written on the lead sheet, without ever have heard the song, played the song, or even seen the sheet before. </span> </p>
