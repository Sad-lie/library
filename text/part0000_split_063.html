   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Few things can make a good musician shudder more than learning something they don’t yet know. And for many musicians – beginning and advanced alike – sightreading is one of those things. Many of us know how important it is to be able to make sense of a written piece of music, but for those who are uninitiated it can be a daunting task. The truth is that it is not always easy – there is no shortcut to being fluent in the language of the staff – but that doesn’t mean that it has to be terribly hard either. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This book has outlined the fundamentals; it has, hopefully, started you on your path. Use it as a guide and as a reference. It cannot do the work for you, however, and reading through it cannot all by itself guarantee you success. What you need is time and effort. You need to put in the energy. Practice these things, make them part of your life, and it will pay dividends. Return to this guide to brush up on the fundamentals. Seek out new resources to teach you more advanced concepts. Learn to apply all of the theory you have learned or are learning to the written page. Learn to write music. Practice sightreading your favorite songs. In any case, put in the time. It is worth it. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Following this conclusion, there is a collection of exercises designed to help you internalize some of the things this book has discussed. It is highly recommended that you work through those exercises. But do not stop there. Return to them, rework them. Design your own. Always learn, always grow. Inspiration is born of effort.</span> </p>
