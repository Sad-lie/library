   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre10"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">These exercises are written for C instruments (instruments tuned to concert pitch) on a treble clef. If your instrument requires another clef, such as bass clef, and/or is tuned to something other than C, then you will need to transpose the exercises. Transposition will be discussed shortly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre48">1. Naming the notes</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre13"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The first step toward gaining confidence sightreading is to have deep familiarity with the notes of the staff. It isn’t enough to simply know the notes, you have to be able to recognize them in the context of melodic and harmonic structures quickly. While it will be necessary to recognize entire structures at once (such as chords and scale parts), that will come with time as you practice reading. What you can work on right now is learning the staff completely so that you can effortlessly identify notes. This first exercise is all about gaining that effortlessness. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">What you will be doing is identifying, naming, and writing down the notes in some melodic sequence (including all of the notes of any chord and that chord’s name). For each of the scores included at the end of this exercises chapter, move one by one through the notes and write down their names on a piece of paper. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Once you have done that, you can begin to play those notes on your instrument. Moving one by one, play each note that you have named and written on your instrument.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This exercise will help you to gain fluency and will connect your mind to the page directly. Playing the notes on your instrument will begin the process of connecting your instrument right to the written music.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre48">2. Transposing</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre13"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">If your instrument is tuned to something other than C, or if you need to read music in a clef other than treble clef, then you will need to transpose any standard treble clef sheets. Even if this is not the case, transposition is a great way to get a handle on key signatures. In this exercise, you will be transposing music into different keys and clefs. This will help you to orient yourself to the way different keys interact, and will help you to see the same musical structure written in different places on a staff.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">For each of the included exercises, you will first transpose the music from treble clef into bass clef. You will need a blank staff, which can be found here: </span><a href="https://www.blanksheetmusic.net"><span class="calibre37">https://www.blanksheetmusic.net</span></a><span class="calibre3">. Begin by writing the clef symbol (paying careful attention to where it rests on the staff) and the signatures. Then, for each note of the piece written in treble clef, find the corresponding note on the bass clef. Write the piece on bass clef.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Once you have written the piece in bass clef, you will go back to the original sheet (in C) and transpose it to Bb. Bb is what Tenor and Soprano saxes are written in.  To do this, you need to understand the way instrument tuning works. If an instrument is in C (also known as concert pitch) then a C on the piano is a C on that instrument. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">If the instrument is in Bb, however, then a concert C (on the piano) is a Bb on that instrument. That means that a C on that instrument is actually a concert D. So every concert note needs to be shifted down by one full step.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">To do this, identify the key of the piece you are transposing and write the new key signature, which will be a full step down. Now take each note and write it a step down as well. That will be a fully transcribed version of the piece.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre48">3. Clapping</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Once you have practiced familiarizing yourself with the harmonic and melodic structure of a piece, time is next. The best way to immerse yourself into musical time is to clap your hands to the pulse and time signature of a piece of music. For each of the pieces included, note the time signature.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Begin slowly, and try to clap or tap your hands to the rhythmic values of each note – clapping where there is a note and not clapping where there is a rest. Be sure to be accurate. If you have to, refer to the section of this book on rhythmic value and double check yourself. Once you have a handle on the feel of the song, increase the speed until you are clapping at the correct tempo.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre48">4. Sightreading</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Now it is time for the real work. To take what you have practiced and put it all together, it is time to sightread pieces of music. In this exercise, you will start slow and build to playing pieces at full speed. For each piece included here, move slowly through the piece and play each note or chord separately. Be sure to be accurate, even if it means moving very slowly. If you make a mistake, it is ok, simply start over. Take breaks when you need to.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">You will want to begin by playing each of the notes, taking into account their rhythmic values, as slowly as you can while maintaining some kind of pulse. Once you can do that accurately, it is time to increase the speed. Work up to playing each piece at the notated tempo. Once you have done that, you will be reading a sheet of music!</span> </p>
