   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This guide is meant to introduce the reader to the syntax and semantics of the written word of music. It is not, in itself, a guide to the structure of the music that we write down – the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic forms that govern most of the music written or performed in the west in the modern era. That is the province of music theory, which is a fundamentally different thing than musical notation. However, the two are linked in a variety of important ways – at every turn, it seems, notation and theory work together. For that reason, there will be cause to lapse into theoretical explanations in this work from time to time. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre27"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The reader is strongly urged, however, to have a guide designed to introduce them specifically to theory. This book is in some ways designed to have a sibling, and that sibling is my </span><span class="calibre36">Music Theory: From Absolute Beginner to Expert</span><span class="calibre3"> book, which I strongly recommend that you read before (if you’re new to music theory) or alongside this book.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">This is an in-depth book that dives into how music theory works and explains everything in an easy to follow way. It helps you build a solid foundation by explaining important concepts in a way that facilitates practicality and understanding. These two books together form a body of knowledge that will be of tremendous use to any musician.</span> </p>
