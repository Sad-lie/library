   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The most important thing about a sheet of music are the notes written on the staff. The signatures, tempo, clef, and other markings will tell you all the things you need to know before wading into the pool, but swimming is a matter of reading the specific notes—the single-note lines and the chords, the sounds and the rests. This is where the compositional magic happens, and it is where the performer gets all of the information they will need to make beautiful music (so long as they are capable).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">There are two components to a written note:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">1. Pitch</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">2. Duration. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">The duration is a matter of rhythm, and will be discussed in the section of this book pertaining to timing. Right now, the focus is on how to read what a note is telling us about its pitch. Fundamentally, this is a simple matter. There are, again, two features to consider:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">1. The placement of the note on the staff, and </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">2. Any alterations to the normal course of that placement. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre14"> <span class="calibre3">Together, these two things will tell you exactly what pitch to play.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">In general, the pitch of a note is determined by where it is vertically on the staff. As we have seen, each place on the staff (on each different clef) has a distinct pitch—if we assume that we are talking about the treble clef in C major, then the lowest line is always E</span><span class="calibre184">4</span><span class="calibre3">, the middle line is always B</span><span class="calibre184">4</span><span class="calibre3">, and the space below the top line is always F</span><span class="calibre184">5</span><span class="calibre3">. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">So any note placed on those parts of the staff (or any other parts) will have the corresponding pitch values. A note (that is unaltered) on the bottom line of the treble clef in C will always be E, regardless of how that note looks like and whether that is a whole note, an eighth note, or a sixteenth note. A similar note on the middle line of that same staff will always be a B, and so on. In this way, we know what the pitch value of a note is—whether that note is part of a single-note line (when it is the only note occurring at that vertical slice of the staff) or whether it is part of a chord (when it is joined at the same vertical slice of the staff to other notes). </span> </p>
