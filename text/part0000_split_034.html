   <p class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">Time and key signatures are some of the most important things on a staff. They occur to the immediate right of the clef, and they tell the instrumentalist much of the information they will need to know before beginning to play or learn the piece they are reading. Once mastered, reading a signature is like noticing the color of the paper that a poem is printed on—it affects you without you even knowing it. The aim is not to pause over the signatures and consider them, but to see them and immediately know the information they are presenting you with (information that you will need as you begin reading the notes written on the staff). In general, the key signature tells you about the key of the song, which identifies the way in which the seven notes represented by the staff lines and spaces are altered in each octave, while the time signature tells you how many of what kind of note can fit into each bar (thus telling you how to “count” or “tap” the pulse of the music).</span> </p>
