He was tow-haired and short, about five feet five, and he spoke with the accent of his native San Diego. He looked as if he should have had a skateboard or a surfboard tucked under his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After graduating from high school, Dames had joined the Army. He had ended up in the intelligence corps, had learned Chinese, and had been sent to a National Security Agency listening post on Taiwan. His job was, for the most part, to eavesdrop on sensitive military communications within mainland China.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On Taiwan, Dames fell in love with an attractive woman from Taipei, divorced his high-school sweetheart from California, and at the ripe age of twenty, embarked on his second marriage. Unfortunately, being married to a foreign citizen disqualified Dames from his listening post job, <a id="filepos657405"></a>which required special-access signals-intelligence clearances. After working in less interesting positions for a while, he left the Army. He earned a degree in Chinese, considered studying engineering and working as a civilian, but eventually realized that civilian life bored him. He went back to the Army, this time as an officer. By the early 1980s he was at Fort Meade, as part of INSCOM’s Systems Exploitation Detachment. Dames considered his branch of SED, which was concerned with analyzing certain hightech Soviet weapons projects, to be an elite unit of creative thinkers who didn’t care about the rule book. He was proud to be there.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The posting seemed to suit him, too, for Dames was intelligent and creative, and brimmed with a restless energy, an impulsiveness that could have doomed him in a more orthodox military setting. Growing up in California, he would later reminisce, he had been something of an excitable boy, “burning woods down, vandalizing graveyards, any number of things,” just for fun—“If it hadn’t been for corporal punishment, I’d be in a penitentiary now.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">He ran on the cross-country team in high school, and would always be intensely athletic, running and weight lifting, anything to soak up the excess energy. He made his first parachute jump from an airplane when he was sixteen. He was also philosophically restless; as a boy he was captivated by stories of UFOs, Bigfoot, the paranormal in general. He wanted to know what it was all about. At Berkeley, where he studied for a few years after leaving Taiwan, he experimented with Zen meditation, and once had an <a id="filepos659219"></a>out-of-body experience. Unfortunately, like many first-timers, he had a bad trip, becoming briefly terrified by the thought that he wouldn’t be able to get back into his body. After that, he vowed never to have an OBE again.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Still, his interest in the occult continued. While at Fort Meade, he heard about the remote-viewing unit, and soon <a id="filepos659646"></a>became a regular visitor to the unit’s tree-shaded buildings. He began to send the unit intelligence targets from his office at SED, and when results came back, he took them seriously. He was as enthusiastic as anyone about remote viewing’s potential; he saw it as a revolution in intelligence-collection technology.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames also took an interest in the remote-viewing training program out at SRI. He saw that Rob Cowart and Tom Nance, who had already begun their training, were Army captains like him, fresh from the advanced intelligence course at Fort Huachuca. They were no more “natural” psychics than he was. Indeed, in the wake of the debacle with Harary and Langford and Hammid, Swann had told the program’s managers that he didn’t want natural psychics. He wanted intelligent Army officers with a willingness to learn his new technique. That technique, Swann seemed to be promising, would give them plenty of talent, making them better than the best natural psychics.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It wasn’t long before Dames was sounding out Skip Atwater, asking him if he might be able to join the training program himself. The more he thought about it, the less he wanted to do anything else with his Army career. The idea of it was like some fantastic dream: training at the feet of the great Ingo Swann, and then doing battle in the etheric heavens with the evil Russian “extrasensors,” as they were being called. He was, he said, a good man for the job.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By late 1983, it was clear that the unit’s budget would pay for the sending of four more officers to SRI. Swann would train these four INSCOM personnel, and afterward his remote-viewing technology would be deemed to have been transferred to the U.S. government. In other words, Swann’s trainees could go on to train their own students in the same techniques. And no one else would ever sit at the feet of the master.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames eventually convinced Skip Atwater and Brian Busby to take him in. Alas, they did not plan to turn him <a id="filepos661981"></a>into a remote viewer—Atwater and Busby felt they had enough of those—but instead into a remote-viewing monitor and analyst. Nevertheless, it was believed that as an analyst, he would benefit from the same training received by actual remote viewers. General Stubblebine signed off on Dames’s inclusion, and the young officer was accepted as one of the final four.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">At some point, Ed Dames was introduced to his fellow students. One was Captain Bill Ray, a counterintelligence officer, originally from Anaheim, California. Six feet one, in his late thirties, he had graying dark hair, a mustache, an athletic build, and chronic back problems from an old parachuting accident. Ray was a staunch Irish Catholic, liked being a soldier, liked his beer, liked to sing sentimental Irish songs off key, and always seemed to be smoking or chewing on an old pipe.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Captain Paul Smith, an Arabic speaker, had come from an INSCOM operations unit in Germany. He was stout and friendly, with thick glasses and thinning hair. He liked heavy metal music, but was also a devout Mormon.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The last member of the team was Charlene Cavanaugh, a civilian analyst in her late thirties who worked for INSCOM. Slim, dark-haired, pretty, and outgoing, she knew Stubblebine, and was said to have performed quite well at some of his spoonbending parties. Others at INSCOM liked the way she carried herself. To Ed Dames, however, the fact that Cavanaugh was female, and a civilian—two qualities frequently regarded with disdain by male military officers—slightly deflated the grandeur of the collective experience they were about to undergo.<a id="filepos663846" href="#filepos695390">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">But never mind, the dream was about to begin. It quickly became clear that it would proceed through stages, <a></a>through trials to be overcome, like the Hero’s Journey that is ubiquitous in mythology. With each trial, Dames and the others would find their lives being altered further. At the end, they hoped, though few put it this way, there would be the final, transformed products—four trained shamans with special-access clearances.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The first stage on this path was reached on a Saturday late in 1983, when Dames and the others drove down to the Monroe Institute. The institute was two hours south of Washington, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Dames and his fellow trainees, along with a dozen other officers from INSCOM headquarters, were to spend six days there, practicing deeper and deeper altered states with the help of the Monroe audio technology.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Normally, for private clients who came to Monroe, the course was called “Gateway Voyage.” But INSCOM needed to justify the course, in its budget request, as something that would contribute to the professional development of its officers. Thus, within the Army, the course was given the evocative acronym RAPT—for “Rapid Advanced Personal Training.” Although Dames and the others were now essentially committed to the remote-viewing program for a three-year tour, they believed that the Monroe course was meant to help prepare them, broadening their minds for what was to come. Either that, or it would make clear to them, and to those running the RV program, that their minds lacked the requisite broadness.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Oddly enough, the Monroe Institute owed its involvement with the Army to Skip <a id="filepos665890"></a>Atwater’s mother. Learning of her son’s involvement in psi matters in the mid-1970s, she had referred him to the institute, which friends of hers had attended. The institute was then on an old farm near Charlottesville, Virginia; by the early 1980s it had moved a dozen or so miles away, and comprised a set of modern buildings on a remote hilltop. A man named Bob Monroe had started it all.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos666376"></a>Monroe had been a successful radio producer back in the 1950s, when one day in 1958 he had begun to suffer from severe insomnia, and then had begun to have out-of-body experiences. No one then seemed to know anything about such experiences. Doctors told him he was probably having a nervous breakdown of some sort. Monroe didn’t think so, and he began to experiment, setting up a small laboratory in his radio production facility, with a special darkened booth for OBE subjects to lie in. To keep subjects from falling asleep in the booth, he played music through headphones. Somewhere around this time Monroe decided that sound was an excellent tool for manipulating states of consciousness, in ways that had never been tried before.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Altered states such as those in which OBEs occurred were, to a certain extent, physiologically measurable. Using electroencephalographs and other scanning devices, one could clearly see the changes in brain waves and brain-activity patterns. After a certain amount of tinkering and theorizing, Bob Monroe came up with the following idea for controlling those patterns: One could play sound with frequencies that matched the brain-wave frequencies, because the brain had a tendency to <em class="calibre4">mimic</em> the frequencies presented to it that way. Monroe decided, however, to present this mind-bending sound pattern in an indirect manner. He knew that when one frequency was presented to one ear, and a separate frequency to the other ear, the <em class="calibre4">difference</em> between those frequencies (e.g., 8,000 Hz minus 7,990 Hz equals 10 Hz) was also perceptible to the mind. It was what communications engineers called the “beat frequency.” Monroe decided to present the altered-state-mimicking sound patterns as beat frequencies—i.e., one set of frequencies in one ear, and a slightly different set in the other ear, in such a way that the mixture would produce the desired waveform pattern. It seemed to work so well that Monroe patented it, and called it the “Hemi-Sync” method. Soon he had tapes to promote a variety of deeper <a id="filepos668551"></a>and deeper altered states, including those that seemed to favor OBEs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Skip Atwater visited the institute one day in 1977, privately, and explained to Bob Monroe that he had his own history of OBEs. Monroe put him on a small cot in a darkened room, and placed headphones on his ears. Then he turned on a Hemi-Sync tape.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><em class="calibre4">What the</em>—<em class="calibre4">?</em> Atwater felt the table lifting into the air. Was Monroe trying to jump-start the out-of-body process by jacking up the bed? Whatever Monroe was doing, it worked. Atwater floated around strange landscapes for a while, and then heard Monroe’s voice on the tape, commanding him to come back into his body, back to “physical matter reality.” After the session, with the lights on, Atwater got up from the bed and looked beneath it, expecting to see some kind of hydraulic lifting apparatus. There was none.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater became a regular visitor to the institute, as did Joe McMoneagle, and Colonel John Alexander, and even Major General Stubblebine. They began <a id="filepos669803"></a>sharing Hemi-Sync tapes with others at INSCOM or in Grill Flame, to help them cool down before remote-viewing sessions, or to cure insomnia or jet lag.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the early 1980s the Monroe Institute was offering guided courses with the tapes. In the picturesque setting of the misty Blue Ridge Mountains, people could explore the strangest reaches of their inner space. Students in the main course, Gateway Voyage, would lie in small, darkened cubicles—“Controlled Holistic Environmental Chambers”—for several hours a day, for five straight days. They lay semi- or completely naked, under blankets, listening to Hemi-Sync tapes and experiencing weird visual phenomena, or disembodied voices, or vivid memory flashbacks, or full-blown OBEs, or simply their own meandering streams of consciousness. Afterward they would sit around informally and <a id="filepos670748"></a>discuss their experiences with everyone else in the group, often with little inhibition and great emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Stubblebine enjoyed the experience so much he began to send dozens of INSCOM officers there. An Army bus would leave Arlington Hall (where INSCOM headquarters was located) on Fridays, just to take people down. Some loved it, and came back with stories of strange altered-state excursions. Lyn Buchanan had his first OBE experience there. Lying in his chamber one afternoon, listening to one of the Monroe tapes, he tried to scratch an annoying itch on his chin, but suddenly felt as if his hand were wearing a glove. Holding his arm before his eyes, he saw that it was now glowing and translucent; his other, physical arm was still down by his side. He experimented with his new, ghostly arm, putting it through the wall of the chamber, and into the bed. When he put it back into his ordinary arm, the two suddenly melded together, and the strange experience ended. But it left him with the conviction—deeper than any the Bible had ever given him—that his spirit was somehow more real than his physical body.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Not everyone had such experiences; in fact, not everyone understood how altered states at the Monroe Institute contributed to the mission of Army intelligence. Some considered the institute’s work an <a id="filepos672237"></a>outrage, brainwashing, hysteria, even satanic. Others wondered how the group-therapy atmosphere at Monroe, in which people sat around in casual clothes, emoting and hugging each other, could ever really be compatible with rank-and-file military culture.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But for Dames, Ray, Smith, and Cavanaugh, as for most if not all of the remote viewers before them, the Monroe experience was all right. It was the start of their heroic journey. None of them had OBEs while in the course, but some of the tapes seemed fairly intense, mind-stretching. Dames would lie in his darkened cubicle—Paul Smith, his roommate, had his own cubicle a few yards away—and <a id="filepos672976"></a>would put headphones on. He would wait as a Monroe staff person in a nearby control room put in a tape. The first time it happened, he was almost ecstatic with anticipation. He felt that his life would never again be the same.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For a typical visitor to Monroe, lying naked in his or her cubicle, the experience began with a prelude sequence featuring gently crashing waves—<em class="calibre4">shhhhhhhhhhh</em>—of synthesized noise. Then Bob Monroe’s voice drifted in through the headphones, guiding the visitor through various exercises, preparatory visualizations, and subtly, behind everything, there were the Hemi-Sync tones.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The visitor now began to drift through the strange upside-down sub terrain mapped by Bob Monroe … through gentle “Focus 10,” where his arms and legs and torso stilled and slept … through higher-pitched, narcotic “Focus 12” … through portentous “Focus 15,” where the sense of time was left behind … then up and up, the tones rising madly, though multicolored cloud layers, through the cloud-tops, incredible, tingling, muscles tensing, temporal lobes seizing, manic, orgasmic, hallucinogenic “Focus 21” … an alternate reality, indescribable—</p>
<p class="calibre_14">—and then gently back down again, through the clouds, the Hemi-Sync tones singing quietly beneath the evocatively synthesized surf, beneath Bob Monroe’s hypnotic voice.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As the week wore on, participants in the course found themselves going deeper and deeper into altered states, and more easily each time. They found that living in altered states in the daytime, focusing on those drifting, dreamlike experiences, was like living in another world. They were more relaxed, more introspective, more attuned to the hidden potentials that were always being talked about. They were effectively allowed only several hours of sleep per night—a sleep punctuated by wildly vivid, intense dreams—but that was all right, too; they seemed to get <a id="filepos675377"></a>plenty of rest during the day, listening to the Hemi-Sync tapes.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Between the tapes and the group meetings they could walk out the ground-floor door of the Monroe building, near the meeting room, and it was as if they were walking out into space almost. A broad lawn stretched down in front of them into a valley, which rose up steeply again into a range of hills, with trees and fields, and someone’s llama farm over there somewhere. After a particularly deep tape—“Freeflow Focus 12” worked wonders for some people—those trees and fields and hills could take on an amazing, floating, LSD-trip vividness. One look and the candidate remote viewers could see why Bob Monroe had chosen this spot to build his institute, his inner-space launch pad.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Bob Monroe was all right, too. His ideas might have seemed a bit exotic, but somehow they went down more easily because Monroe himself possessed such a worldly gravity. He was a kindly, gray-haired man in his sixties, with a mellow, southern-tinted accent, a lingual amalgam of all the places he had lived. The only hints of his otherworldly intercourse were two rather severe <a id="filepos676686"></a>dark circles under his eyes; his sleep patterns had been permanently altered a quarter century before, at the start of his own journey, and he now slept only a few hours at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When candidates in the remote-viewing program visited the Monroe Institute, they did so in the company of other INSCOM personnel, not ordinary civilians. But even in this somewhat secretive military environment, where no one asked too many questions about what a fellow student did back in Washington, there was a special inner circle of experiment and experience, consisting of those who were part of the remote-viewing program.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Monroe and his staff, for example, had a small research project that focused on Joe McMoneagle. In their research building, they had a special altered-state chamber, sound <a id="filepos677621"></a>proofed, utterly dark, with a half-filled water bed set to human skin temperature. McMoneagle, wearing headphones, would sink into the bed and float down through his inner space. Monroe and his staff would sit in a control room outside, monitoring McMoneagle’s state of consciousness via a number of electrical leads taped to his body. One set measured the electrical resistance of his skin; another the voltage between his head and his toes. When the values reached a certain level, it meant that Joe had gone into his zone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">They experimented for months with special Hemi-Sync tones and tapes, trying to boost McMoneagle’s RV performance. (They only succeeded in shortening his cool-down time.) They taught the beefy warrant officer to have OBEs almost at will, and found that when he did so, the voltage between his head and his toes suddenly <em class="calibre4">reversed</em>. Why that should have been, no one seemed to know.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Down at Monroe, on the Gateway Course, Ed Dames and his fellow trainees heard the stories about McMoneagle’s OBEs—plus some stranger ones. One time, for example, Bob Monroe had given Joe McMoneagle a target to remote-view, and McMoneagle had described an evolution-promoting energy being who had somehow come to Earth many years ago. The target, it turned out, was Jesus Christ. Another, less well-known entity, “Miranon,” from somewhere else in space and time, seemed actually to possess Bob Monroe one day in the early 1980s, speaking through him like a spirit through a medium. In effect, Monroe’s OBE session had turned into a “channelling” session. At the time Dames and the others first visited the institute, Miranon still possessed Bob fairly often. Bob had even given his guest’s name to the pleasant lake down in the valley, Lake Miranon, where Monroe students swam naked on summer afternoons, cleansing themselves for their next dark adventures.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the strangest story was the one about Bob Monroe’s <a id="filepos679848"></a>encounter with the mysterious <a id="filepos679886"></a>Inga Arnyet. Monroe had gone out of body one day, had been out in space, in some sparsely populated nether zone, when suddenly he had sensed a human presence. A woman. A foreign woman. The name “Inga Arnyet” came to him, and Monroe had the impression that she was a KGB “extrasensor,” one of the Soviet counterparts of America’s remote viewers. She had been trying to psychically zero in on America’s remote-viewing program somehow, yet for some reason the only landing zone open to her had been in the alternate reality then inhabited by Bob Monroe. She hovered, watching him, sensing him, inside this weird and timeless OBE tableau. She seemed pleasant and unthreatening, but who could tell what she was up to? Was she reading his mind? Trying to read U.S. military secrets? Monroe quietly mentioned the incident to Skip Atwater, and suggested he look for an Inga Arnyet on the Pentagon’s list of known Soviet intelligence personnel.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater checked it out, but never found the name anywhere. Even so, the story spread among the Fort Meade initiates, and grew wings; it was a nice shamanic tale to get them on their way. After the Cold War was over, Ed Dames would claim to have heard more or less the same story, a story about Soviet extrasensors invading the mind of some elderly American gentleman, from a former KGB officer he met on the New Age conference circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ingo Swann would later say that he had not wanted to start the training program when he did. By the autumn of 1982, he had only reached Stage Three of his complex technique. But the DIA’s Jack Vorona and Jim Salyer, and the Army, had put the pressure on, had made clear that it was now or never. Perhaps they had foreseen the climate shift that was about to occur.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In any case, Swann finally gave in. The first students, Tom Nance and Rob Cowart, arrived that November. Each <a id="filepos682011"></a>month thereafter, more or less, they spent two weeks at SRI in training, and the other two back at Fort Meade. Soon Rob was forced to withdraw, after his cancer diagnosis. Later came two civilians from the National Security Agency—a woman named Debbie Norfeld, who was to be trained as a remote viewer, and a man named Richard Henderson, who was to be trained as her RV monitor and analyst. Unfortunately, after they had made a few visits, NSA suddenly backed out of the program. It turned out that Norfeld and Henderson’s office apparently hadn’t received the proper authorization for their participation in the strange training program at SRI. The higher-ups at NSA clamped down, and Swann never heard from Norfeld or Henderson again. Some time later, their training interleaved with Nance’s, there were two trainees from another <a id="filepos682879"></a>secretive agency. Finally, there were the four from INSCOM.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">If Swann had begun his training program under pressure, at short notice, it wasn’t evident by the time Ed Dames and the other three arrived at SRI in the spring of 1984. Swann was now in the didactic mode he seemed to like best. He made the rules, taught what he wanted, and his pupils obeyed and listened, or they were gone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">First there were lectures, given by Swann from the head of the RV table. Dames and the others would sit around the table and take notes, and afterwards—and overnight for homework—they would have to write essays on what Swann had said. Swann put great emphasis on the precise definition of certain key words, words like “structure,” “matrix,” “ideogram,” “cognitron,” “signal line,” “feeling-motion,” “aperture,” “mind-dynamic process.” Lectures were by far the least enjoyable part of the experience.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Even practice sessions were arduous, especially in the early months, with the focus on Stage One, and ideograms. Ideograms were the big trial of remote viewing, the wilderness <a></a>one had to cross before one could achieve apotheosis. For hours and days, Swann called out the geographical coordinates of various easy targets, and Dames let his pen shake across the paper, and more often than not, Swann responded with a stony silence. Swann said he did not believe in negative reinforcement, in saying, “That’s incorrect.” To him, this only promoted despair, and thus damaged the neural-rewiring process of learning. When he wanted to signify failure, he said nothing. Dames and the others soon came to dread these nothings.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eventually, after weeks of lectures and one-on-one practice sessions, Dames found that his ideograms were beginning to resemble the shapes that Swann said they should. Then he would do quick sessions, running from ideograms to Stage Two basic sensory perceptions, to dimensionals and rough, Stage Three sketches, vocalizing as he worked, “rolling” … “wavy” … “terrain” … “sandy” … “dry” … “hot” … “expansive” … and if it was a good day Swann would curtly respond “correct” … “correct” … “correct” to almost every bit of information as the session unfurled.<a id="filepos685703" href="#filepos695564">*</a> And finally Swann would say, “Okay, let’s end the session,” and putting his cigar down for a moment, he would hand Dames the target folder, and Dames would open it the way one might open a Christmas present, full of expectation and wonder, and there would be a clipping from <em class="calibre4">National Geographic</em>, with dramatic orange-brown dunes of the Sahara, a high sea of sand—sandy, dry, hot, expansive—and Dames would beam, barely able to contain his grin. “Pat yourself on the back,” Swann <a></a>would say, for he did believe in positive reinforcement. On the other hand, he often made a student who had finished a good session “rest” for several hours, or even quit for the day, when all the student wanted to do was more remote viewing. Swann was constantly worried about “overtraining,” overstretching the synapses until the developing structure collapsed.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">For all Swann’s prickliness and idiosyncrasies, Dames and the others began to love him, the way one begins to love, as retrospect nears, a stern drill sergeant or a tough but skillful schoolteacher. Some of them even likened Swann to those <em class="calibre4">Star Wars</em> characters, old Yoda and bearded Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise instructors on Luke Skywalker’s path to Jedi knighthood. Swann seemed to welcome the comparison.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Had remote-viewing training produced no new talents in the group from INSCOM, their sentiments toward Swann would have been far different. But all did well enough to be convinced, at a deep level, that it was all real, that they were developing a fantastic skill that could be useful. Some of them, at times during sessions, experienced a phenomenon that Swann came to call <em class="calibre4">bilocation</em>. Although CRV sessions normally proceeded with the viewer in a relatively awake, unaltered state of consciousness, a bilocation was a brief moment of total hallucination, a visionary flash in which the viewer had a deep, dreamlike awareness of the target. He suddenly lost touch with his surroundings, and was, as far as he could tell, <em class="calibre4">at</em> the target site, experiencing it with raw, sometimes overpowering emotional and sensory force—before he just as quickly snapped back again to the real world. When a bilocation happened, Swann made the viewer say and write “bilo break,” and often terminated the session. Remote viewers who had experienced bilocations never forgot them. Paul <a id="filepos688367"></a>Smith would experience one during training, switching rapidly between a multi-sensory vision of Kwajalein atoll in the South Pacific, and the city streets where he was actually walking.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames and the others came to Swann for training two weeks every month or so, through the spring and summer of 1984. In Menlo Park, the four stayed in a local hotel, and when they were not in lectures, or waiting in the “recovery room” for their next RV session, they could loiter at pool-side, or go to the beach, or take in a movie. For a while, as part of the program, they underwent personality and neurological tests, but that didn’t take long, and as training progressed, they had a remarkable amount of freedom. Weekends were the best, for Swann forbade drinking at all other times. Friday afternoon would come, and Swann would set down his pen and cigar for the day, and Dames might open his briefcase and take out a six-pack he’d stashed away, and when the group had consumed those, they would go out for more drinks, and dinner. Swann would often go with them—now fun-loving, amusingly voluble Ingo. Then Monday would dawn, one or two of the fellows nursing hangovers, and training would resume.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ingo liked the four of them, liked to socialize with them, and liked the training program generally. But he didn’t like Menlo Park; his heart had always been in New York City, where he still managed, with trips here and there, to spend a large part of his time. By prior arrangement with INSCOM, he moved his training school back to Manhattan in the summer of 1984. SRI had an office in midtown, where Swann set up an RV room and a control room like the one in California. Dames and the others now merely had to take a short flight up from Washington, and could go home on weekends. Common was the sight, that summer, of bearded, graying Ingo, leading three younger men and a woman around Manhattan landmarks, inviting them to experience <a id="filepos690490"></a>the feeling-motion of a skyscraper, or the Stage Two texture of a lonely, soot-dusted tree.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Over a few beers, or otherwise running around Manhattan or the San Francisco Bay Area having a good time, Ed Dames seemed to consider himself one of the guys. But in his heart of hearts, he held himself apart. He believed that he alone understood the historical crest they all were riding; he believed that he alone was a true student of remote viewing, ready to take it back to the Army, to study it, to expand it, to make it better. He thought of himself as Ingo’s one true protégé, his Luke Skywalker, groomed to become, in his words, “caretaker of the technology.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann, however, took a slightly different view. He liked Dames; he considered the young officer intelligent, and highly motivated. But Dames wasn’t really meant to be a remote viewer, just a monitor and analyst. Swann considered his true protégé to be Tom <a id="filepos691613"></a>Nance. The dark-haired Army captain, in Swann’s view, was the formal prototype for the CRV-trained military remote viewer, the best that could be achieved. Dames and his classmates would train over several months, but Nance’s training, begun in late 1982, would not really end until Swann’s contract with INSCOM expired two years later.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Nance had jet-black hair and a mustache, and his face was handsome, vaguely impish. He brought a certain patience and precision to his RV work—but he also had, like Dames, a fierce independent spirit. He owned a motorcycle, and loved to travel long distances on the open road, <em class="calibre4">Easy Rider</em> style. Some of the others wondered what he was doing in the Army.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Nance became closer to Swann than any other student had been, and by most accounts, he was the best ever to emerge from Swann’s training program. His sessions might start slow, with a few pages to get Stage One right—declaring “miss break” after each attempt, and taking the coordinates <a></a>again—but by the end it would often seem that he had grasped the signal line as tightly as anyone ever could. In May 1984, near the close of his formal training program (he would return later for refresher work), Swann put him through a valedictory series of sessions, designed to showcase his talents. The results were bound into a red folder and shown to Army and DIA officials.<a id="filepos693203" href="#filepos696063">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of the targets was Grand Coulee Dam. Nance had not only drawn it accurately, describing it as a dam, but had also made a Stage Six model in white clay, depicting the dam, and a small attached building near the riverbank. Later an SRI photographer had been sent out to take a picture of the dam from the same angle; the photo now lies next to the photo of Nance’s almost identical clay model.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Another target was a certain site in Tulsa, Oklahoma, architecturally a zoo of geometries—globes and pyramids and cubes. The site reminded Nance of the Vatican, and of Disneyland; it was churchlike, school-like, and also a quiet place, “funereal.” The strange geometric shapes began to appear on the session paper, first alone and then organized together. By Stage Four, Nance had identified the place as a university. At the end he had actually named the site, Oral Roberts University.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There was Bunker Hill National Monument, in Boston, which Nance sketched—with tourists—and named. There was Grant’s Tomb in New York, named and drawn in neat detail. There was also a site in Mexico somewhere, gradually taking shape as the session wore on, a disused place, grand, overlooking the sea, a temple to forgotten gods. Nance tried Stage Seven phonics: “Tuh” “too” “luh” “loo” —“Tulum.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Six years later, following Nance’s divorce, master and protégé would travel to the Yucatán together, among other <a id="filepos695090"></a>things visiting the ancient temple at Tulum. And Nance would experience, as remote viewers often do when they encounter their targets in the real world, a certain strange thrill that told him he had already been there.</p>

<p id="filepos695390" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos663846">*</a> Dames in an interview said he did eventually soften his views in this area.</p>
<p id="filepos695564" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos685703">*</a> Swann gave constant feedback throughout such sessions, in the same way a piano teacher might provide a running commentary as a student played. As a learning-reinforcement technique, it made sense, but of course it removed any experimental value the session results might have had. For rigorous experiments, no such feedback would be given, and the monitor himself would be blind to the actual target.</p>
<p id="filepos696063" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos693203">*</a> Swann apparently was not blinded to these targets, and may have provided some feedback to Nance during the sessions.</p>
