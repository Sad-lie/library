<p class="calibre_33"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos367635">10</a>  Lawrence Livermore affair: This account comes primarily from a high-level source formerly associated with the remote-viewing program. Two other sources, plus Robertson and Hawke, provided some corroboration, especially of the technical details of the experiments with Geller. Robertson claimed not to know about some of the stranger paranormal events (the voice on the tape, the apparitions), while Hawke refused comment on all of these strange events, citing a desire to write about his experiences with Geller in detail after he retires from Livermore Laboratory. The episode is also referred to, very briefly and with a less <a></a>dramatic conclusion, in Puthoff and Targ 1977, pp. 164–65. My primary source suggested that the Puthoff and Targ 1977 conclusion was fictionalized, perhaps to protect those involved. That doesn’t mean that it was.</p>
