<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">O</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">H-DARK-THIRTY, THEY CALLED IT IN THE</span></span> A<span><span class="calibre13">RMY</span></span>. W<span><span class="calibre13">AY BEFORE SUN-</span></span>rise. The ringing of the phone snatched Mel Riley out of somewhere deep, as Brigitte stirred beside him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley sleepily picked up the phone. It was Atwater, calling from the office. Riley was needed immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley dressed and drove over to the office, parking next to two black, official-looking cars with Defense Department plates. Their occupants were inside with Watt and Atwater. They wore civilian clothes, and one of them carried a large envelope. No one was introduced. Atwater and Watt looked tired and serious. Watt signed for the envelope, and the two men left.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley went over to the ops building, and Atwater followed with the envelope. Riley lay down on the couch, packed his anxieties away in the imaginary suitcase, and <a id="filepos134695"></a>drifted down to his zone. He was nearing the bottom, fighting sleep. Atwater wanted him to concentrate on something described in the envelope, to envision where it would be at a certain time two days in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley drifted along and eventually sensed something heavy, big, dark, a vehicle. A tank. On a rail car somewhere. After he came out of the zone, he sketched it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater showed the session data to Watt, who raced out the door to his car and drove over to 4554, the INSCOM building, where he had access to a secure phone. He called the Defense Department men from the secure phone, and told them that Riley had described the tank on a rail car. It was what they had hoped to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The Russian T-72 tank is nowadays considered somewhat old and second-rate, compared with the latest American models, but in the late 1970s, it was brand-new, and U.S. intelligence experts knew little about its capabilities. Ideally, they wanted their own T-72, to take apart, to “reverse-engineer.” So they did it the American way: they went out and bought one.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The seller, dealing through an international arms merchant based in the Middle East, was an Eastern European general. Atwater remembers that he was Polish, Riley that he was Romanian.<a id="filepos136242" href="#filepos169848">*</a> Whichever he was, the mysterious general had no direct contact with the United States, only with <a></a>the representatives of the arms dealer, who in turn dealt with U.S. intelligence officials.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The U.S. officials running the operation were, naturally, nervous about the deal. Was it all a double cross, they wondered, a trap for American intelligence? Perhaps the remote viewers could help in the tracking of the tank as the operation progressed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Not long after Scotty Watt came back from his phone call in building 4554, Hartleigh Trent, Ken Bell, and Joe McMoneagle arrived. Riley and Trent went over to the ops building with the envelope.<a id="filepos137082" href="#filepos170629">*</a> Trent, monitored by Riley, sank down into a relaxed state and tried to focus on the object described in the envelope—the tank—this time another few days into the future. Trent found himself on a ship at sea. Riley asked him to peer into the hold. Trent saw a tank and what looked like parts of an aircraft. McMoneagle and Bell described similar scenes. Everyone seemed to be “on” today.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The unit continued to monitor the arms merchant, and the voyage of the tank, over the next few days. But now they did it in “real-time,” not in the future. They watched as the tank started in a rail yard, then moved to a port, and was loaded into the hold of a ship. The ship set sail, with what Riley believed was a Greek captain.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At one point, Joe McMoneagle remote-viewed the ship, monitored by Atwater. He sensed that wherever the ship was (presumably in the Black Sea or the Baltic) it was late at night. He also sensed that the ship was dead in the water. <a id="filepos138269"></a>Whether he was seeing something that had just happened, or was about to happen, he didn’t know, but it was certainly vivid. The first ship was boarded by men wearing black, as in some World War II commando movie. They had come from another large ship that stood nearby. The men held the captain at gunpoint. He had his hands in the air. The other ship pulled alongside, swung a crane over the hold, and winched up the container that held the tank. They were stealing the Pentagon’s multimillion-dollar cargo, just like that.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle began to concentrate on the first ship’s captain, the one standing at gunpoint. He decided to try a “telepathic” interrogation. <em class="calibre4">What’s going on here?</em> he asked the captain. To his surprise, the captain seemed unfazed by the commandos with guns. Everything was going as planned. The hijacking had merely been staged, presumably to cover the trail of the general who was selling the tank. Whether the hijackers were U.S. Special Forces soldiers, or the arms merchant’s hired guns, or even Romanian or Polish sailors, Atwater and McMoneagle never found out.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But one thing they did find out: A few weeks later, a ship that had come from a Middle Eastern port cruised up Chesapeake Bay, and unloaded a special cargo at the Army’s tank R&amp;D center at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. It was a shiny new Soviet T-72.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Early in the program, Skip Atwater, Scotty Watt, and other officials recognized that Joe McMoneagle was simply the best all-around remote viewer in the unit. With his bull-neck build, he looked as if he should have been out playing football, or charging machine-gun nests. But genetics and circumstance had combined to turn him into a one-in-a-million psi savant, a shaman in Army boots.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">An incident in McMoneagle’s childhood recalls the legend of the French warrior-mystic “Joan of Arc.” According to the legend, thirteen-year-old Joan was playing in an <a></a>orchard one day with friends, then sat down, exhausted, by a tree. Suddenly the child world faded away, a strange globe of light settled down nearby, and an adult voice began to speak to her. Such voices, sometimes accompanied by angelic apparitions, went on to tell Joan that she would take up arms and lead beleaguered France to victory in its battles with the invading English army.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle’s own somewhat humbler version of this experience occurred when he was eleven years old, in 1957. He was camping with a group of friends next to an orange grove in his home state of Florida. One night he and his friends were all up late, in the grove, playing one of those primitive combat games that preadolescent boys seem to devise instinctively. One boy, designated “it,” had to run and hide, while the others tried to find him. After a certain number of rounds, it was McMoneagle’s turn to hide. He ran into the dark, climbed an orange tree, found a secure position, and relaxed. He had been playing the game for a few hours now, and was very tired. His eyes closed …</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Someone tapped him. He opened his eyes. A strange, ghostlike woman was floating in space next to the tree. She gently took Joe’s arm, and he floated along with her. The scenery changed. They were in a clearing somewhere, in a forest or a swamp; it felt special. The woman gently lectured Joe on the future. He would grow to be a strong boy. He would join the Army and be sent to a far-off war. Many would be killed there, but Joe would come back all right. The woman’s survey of the future seemed to last an hour, unveiling detail after detail of Joe’s life, up to about 1970, where the path of his future seemed to vanish into a dark wall.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Joe woke up in the tree. What a strange dream.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eight years later he enlisted in the Army and soon entered the Army Security Agency. He was trained in special radio direction finding (RDF) techniques, used by the Army to determine, for example, the location of enemy <a></a>radio transmitters and thus the location of the enemy himself. One of his first posts was on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas, where (under the cover of an air and sea rescue installation) his unit tried to spy electronically on Soviet and Cuban ships and submarines. Late one night in October 1965, as McMoneagle walked with a friend along a road on the island, the landscape suddenly lit up. McMoneagle looked overhead and saw a large, intensely bright disk-shaped UFO. It seemed to hover for a while, and then it skipped to a new position; it skipped six or seven times and then zoomed silently over the broad Atlantic horizon, and the night resumed. The next morning, McMoneagle and his friend felt sick. Like some other close encounter experiencers from the lore, their skin felt sunburned, their eyes felt oddly gritty, and they had flulike symptoms for several days. They didn’t report the incident, for fear they would be transferred.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle didn’t want to be transferred, because he loved the Bahamas. He swam and snorkeled and fished, ate marvelously well, got a good tan, and even lived through a hurricane. Then in 1966 he was sent to a place called Vietnam.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ever since joining the Army at age eighteen, McMoneagle had been having a recurring nightmare. In the nightmare, some kind of <a id="filepos144357"></a>white light kept enveloping him, and McMoneagle always had the impression that the white light meant death. When it became clear that he was headed to a war zone, the nightmares intensified. But when his troop plane arrived at Bien Hoa air base outside Saigon, McMoneagle suddenly had a different vision: He saw himself leaving the war alive and intact. He was going to be all right. The only odd thing was—he saw himself leaving Vietnam in a <em class="calibre4">canary yellow</em> plane. When the vision ended, he told the guy standing next to him what he had seen. <em class="calibre4">This canary yellow plane</em> … The guy looked at him. Okay, Joe.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>McMoneagle spent much of the war in the Vietnamese central highlands, south of the city of Da Nang. The borders of Laos and Cambodia were nearby, and the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army criss-crossed them regularly. McMoneagle was stationed at a series of “firebase” outposts in the area. He had an old, beat-up lawn chair he would lie in when off duty. Sometimes, on a perfectly sunny day or a perfectly starry evening, a strange feeling would come over him, a sense of something about to happen, and he would pack up the lawn chair, put on his helmet and flak jacket, and head for his assigned bunker. Then mortar rounds would scream in from the surrounding forest, and all hell would break loose.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The other fellows started noticing how often Joe seemed to anticipate these attacks. It got so that whenever he would start packing up his lawn chair, some of the rest of them would put down what they were doing and head for their bunkers, too. Eventually, they began to mimic his most arbitrary and inconsequential actions. When Joe tied his boots a different way one day, looping the laces around the back, suddenly half a dozen of the others started tying their boots the same way. A soldier couldn’t be too superstitious in a war like this.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle would later be reluctant to talk about some of his experiences in the war, and not just because some of them were classified. Vietnam evoked the strongest emotions many young servicemen would ever encounter, and McMoneagle, despite his linebackerly gruffness, was probably more emotionally sensitive than the average soldier. It would be said that there were several particularly stressful stretches in his tour of which he had little or no memory.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But no bullet or mortar round ever found him, and despite a helicopter accident that left him with chronic back problems, he made it out on his own two feet. Walking onto the tarmac at the airport in Saigon, he saw the plane that would be taking him home. The Pentagon had <a id="filepos147312"></a>set up a troop plane contract with Braniff Airlines, which had a fleet of passenger aircraft in various garish and pastel colors. Looking at the plane, McMoneagle had to smile. The plane was canary yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In 1970, McMoneagle was posted in southern Germany, with a small electronic-intercept detachment in a forest near the Czech and Austrian borders. The detachment was out on the hairy edge of the Cold War. Every so often a Soviet bomber would steal across the Czech border, flying in at treetop level, trying to stay under the NATO radar. McMoneagle, if he was outside, would suddenly see a series of bright flashes and hear a strange <em class="calibre4">pop pop pop pop</em> noise as the bomber passed overhead. Configured for intelligence-gathering, the bomber had a series of high-powered flashguns in its bomb bay, synced to spy cameras, and these would go off as the plane went by. The plane flew so low, McMoneagle and the others in the detachment liked to say, that they could see the pilot’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One Sunday afternoon, McMoneagle and his wife and a friend were in a nearby Austrian village, having a leisurely lunch and washing it all down with rum concoctions. Whether it was the alcohol, or some arterial blockage, or both, McMoneagle suddenly collapsed, swallowed his tongue, stopped breathing, and went into cardiac arrest. He found himself standing upright, in some kind of out-of-body state, looking down at his actual, physical, dying body. His friend knelt over the body, performing CPR. With every compression of his chest, Joe felt a click, a stab of pain, and for a moment saw out of his physical eyes again—before switching back to his ghostly observer state. When the paramedics came and hauled the body into the ambulance, Joe’s ghost flew alongside the vehicle, zooming in and out of the power lines by the road, following all the way into the emergency room. After the hospital staff started on his body with the defibrillator paddles, Joe began <a></a>a “near-death experience” with all the usual motifs: He felt himself moving up through a tunnel; he was enveloped by a white Light, the same light from his recurring nightmares, but it wasn’t death. It was God, radiating unconditional love. God told Joe to go back to physical reality; he wasn’t going to die. Joe resisted—it felt just great where he was—but then the scene faded, and he sat upright in his hospital bed, crying, wishing he could go back.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There wasn’t any evidence of serious damage on his brain scans, but McMoneagle increasingly seemed like a <a id="filepos150132"></a>new person. He would be talking to someone, and it would seem as if he were conducting a two-track conversation, one auditory and the other telepathic. Were they just voices in his head? Was he going crazy? Reality and imagination seemed to be colliding everywhere. He would lie down on his living room couch for a nap and suddenly would find himself … relocated, with Technicolor clarity … to a beach on a southern ocean, or to a desert, or, once, to a temple in Japan, where he floated through the trees, mesmerized by the creaking sound from the wheel on a wheelbarrow being pushed down a dirt path.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Like many other near-death experiencers, McMoneagle found his worldview changing dramatically, in the direction of the mystical and spiritual. Past events took on a new significance. The glowing woman in the orange grove in 1957—had she been just a dream? His consciousness began to expand until it encompassed all life, all matter, all energy, the universe. His marriage, meanwhile, started to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Late in 1977, he was working for INSCOM at Arlington Hall when the Gondola Wish dragnet caught him up. He was suddenly hoisted into a strange new world, a world where all that had seemed crazy in his life was now appreciated and encouraged.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a></a>Among other things, McMoneagle’s Celtic genes and Austrian near-death experience seemed to have given him a very useful ability—the ability to remain semialert while descending into a dreamlike state of consciousness. Most people achieved such a state, sometimes called “vivid dreaming,” only once in a while, perhaps after a too-heavy meal, or during an illness. But McMoneagle seemed able to enter this magical zone almost at will.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As a result, his remote-viewing visions had a <a id="filepos152333"></a>remarkable realism and narrative consistency. After a session down in his zone, he could often recall and sketch what he had seen down to the tiniest detail. Even during the session, he was occasionally able to describe scenes just as if he were watching a film in a theater. It could be that easy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At times, however, certain strange perceptual distortions crept in that required subtle interpretation. One day in about 1980, a client in the intelligence community came to the Fort Meade unit with a special tasking. The client wanted the remote viewers to track the movements of a person, apparently a foreign <a id="filepos153024"></a>agent based in Europe, at certain specific times—every twelve hours or so—over a period of several days in the recent past.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater soon ran McMoneagle against the target. The target folder had the agent’s photograph inside. On the outside were the specified dates and times when the client wanted to know what he had been doing. Atwater told McMoneagle the target was a person; his task was to describe the person and his surroundings at the times written on the envelope.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle sank down into his zone, and began to run through the list of times. For one of the specified times, he sensed a road. It wound through hills. He realized that the target was the driver of a car on this road. He was male, dark-haired, neatly dressed, perhaps a businessman. McMoneagle described the road, and the hills, and the car, and then about five minutes into the session, something <a id="filepos154071"></a>about the target changed. McMoneagle became confused. “The guy’s going somewhere I can’t go,” he said. “What do you mean?” asked Atwater. “Well,” said McMoneagle, “it’s like I was looking at his picture and the picture turned sideways.” The target had suddenly vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Later, after delivering the session results to the client, Atwater learned that the man in the photograph had failed to appear for a meeting with his case officer. That was why the client had wanted to retrospectively track his movements. Some time after the remote viewers turned in their data, the client discovered that the man—at the point in time where Joe McMoneagle had remote-viewed him—had somehow lost control of his car on a winding road in Italy, and had plunged over a cliff to his death.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">At CIA headquarters one day, Norm Everheart was telephoned by a man he knew from the FBI. The FBI man, who knew about Grill Flame, had a counterintelligence situation that he hoped the remote viewers could help him with. There was one hitch, however. The FBI man was unable to task the remote viewers himself. His boss, on religious or skeptical grounds, or both, refused to let him have any dealings at all with Grill Flame’s psychics. Therefore the FBI man had come to Norm Everheart. Could Everheart handle this for him, under the table? Everheart, a relatively friendly, easygoing man in what was generally a cold and conniving business, said he would be happy to help.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The situation the FBI man was concerned about had come to his attention through sheer luck. On a recent morning, at about six, a local police officer somewhere in suburban Maryland had stopped a car that had gone too quickly past a stop sign. The police officer saw that the car had diplomatic plates. He walked up to the driver’s-side window, and asked to see the driver’s license and registration. The driver, as was clear from the documents, was a <a></a>senior Soviet Embassy official. He was dressed in a business suit, and he was clearly annoyed at having been stopped. Across the backseat of his car, the officer noted, the embassy man had a fishing pole. The policeman’s report soon landed at the FBI’s Soviet counterintelligence office.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A fishing pole … What would a Soviet intelligence officer—assuming that that was what he was—have been doing dressed in a business suit at 6:00 <span><span class="calibre13">A.M</span></span>., driving in suburban Maryland with a fishing pole in his backseat?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Norm Everheart found it odd, too. And it wasn’t the first such case he had heard of. Fishing poles seemed to be sprouting up all over the Soviet diplomatic corps. Either the Soviets were becoming avid fishermen, or the fishing poles concealed some kind of electronic gadget—perhaps a covert communications device or a SIGINT collection system.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart knew of a recent case, in some other country, where the host intelligence service had noticed that a certain Soviet Embassy employee always went out to a certain lake to fish, while some local official—perhaps his agent—fished on the opposite side. Were they communicating hydrophonically, through the poles? An operation was mounted to find out, but nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Whatever was going on, the Soviets who possessed the poles seemed to regard them as incredibly sensitive and valuable. One day, somewhere in Scandinavia, a Soviet Embassy man had been involved in a serious auto accident. He had been lying in his car, bleeding and badly injured, as the paramedics worked on him, but he had loudly refused to be taken to the hospital. He had insisted upon waiting until his colleagues at the embassy arrived and took from him the things he clutched tightly in his hand—five of the mysterious fishing poles.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In some cases, the Soviets took pains to create the impression that they really did like to fish with those ubiquitous poles. In a certain capital city in Africa, a group of <a></a>Soviet Embassy officials—paired as husbands and wives—had developed the habit of going out to a lake in a boat, and sitting there with their fishing poles for hours, apparently fishing. CIA eavesdropping specialists had eventually managed to plant a listening device in the boat, through which they heard the wives complaining: <em class="calibre4">It was Olga’s turn to go this week. Why do I have to be here?</em> And so forth. None of the Soviets said anything that was particularly incriminating, but they clearly regarded this as a duty, rather than recreation. Everheart hoped that the remote viewers would clear up the mystery once and for all.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Joe McMoneagle was one of the first to go after the target. All he knew was that the target was a person whose picture was in the target envelope, at some unstated location at some unstated time. He sank down into his zone and saw a man driving his car, and being stopped by a policeman. The man was dressed in a business suit. He spoke Russian. He had a fishing pole in his backseat. Atwater didn’t even know the fishing pole was supposed to be there; Norm Everheart, with his usual oblique targeting method, hadn’t told him. But now Atwater realized the pole was important, and he directed McMoneagle to press the attack. What was the significance of the fishing pole? How did the man in the car intend to use it?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle decided to ask the man in the car. <em class="calibre4">What are you going to do with that fishing pole?</em> This was an especially strange use of the telepathic interrogation technique, since the target was not only at a different place, but at a different <em class="calibre4">time</em>, at least several days in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Whatever was really happening, McMoneagle seemed to interrogate the KGB man for a while, and then he followed his journey in the car with the pole: The KGB man drove to a wooded area at the edge of a sensitive military installation, which was surrounded by a high perimeter fence. At one point the fence was interrupted by a tall building, and about fifteen feet up the outer wall of the building there <a id="filepos161053"></a>was a loose piece of masonry. The KGB man walked up to the building and telescoped out his fishing pole. He used it to reach up and dislodge a small package that some Soviet-controlled American agent, presumably working at the installation, had wedged into the wall by the loose masonry.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When Everheart read the remote viewer’s data, his heart sank. It just didn’t seem right. In all the other cases in which the pole had made its appearance, it had seemed to harbor some kind of sophisticated electronic device. But according to the remote viewer, the pole was simply being used as a mechanical aid, to service what spies called a “dead-drop” site, a secret place where agents stashed film or other materials for collection by their case officers. Even so, Everheart passed the information on to the man at the FBI. Later he heard that the FBI had staked out the site by the military installation, and had seen the KGB officer using the pole to dislodge something from a chink high up in the side of the building.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle had not only been incredibly accurate—he had helped to break an important case. Now Norm Everheart began to wonder about all the other fishing pole stories. Were the Soviets using the poles simply to hide and retrieve material at elevated and otherwise inaccessible dead-drops? Everheart never knew, but he was satisfied that he had found the answer in at least this one episode.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Like all remote viewers, McMoneagle had a series of three-digit “code numbers” randomly assigned to him. For any remote-viewing session, whether training or operational, he would use one of these to identify himself. It was a practice designed to protect the remote viewers from prying eyes outside the unit. Still, word of his abilities couldn’t help spreading to certain members of the intelligence community, even if they knew him only as a number. During the Carter administration, the National Security Council knew him primarily as Viewer 518, thanks to a sensational <a id="filepos163311"></a>series of sessions he did for them under that numerical <em class="calibre4">nom de guerre</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The National Security Council staff in those years included a Navy lieutenant commander named Jake Stewart, an enthusiastic supporter of Grill Flame. One day in September 1979 Stewart brought Scotty Watt and Skip Atwater a series of photographs recently taken by a KH-9 spy satellite. The photographs depicted a large industrial facility on the edge of a body of water, somewhere in northern Russia. Atwater would later find out that the facility was at the port of Severodvinsk on the White Sea, just below the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Stewart pointed out to Atwater a particular building in the shipyard, Building 402, around which a certain amount of construction was evidently going on. The NSC, he told Atwater, wanted to know what was happening inside that building.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater examined the photograph. The building looked to him like a gymnasium. Then he noticed how tiny everything else was around it; the building was actually more than a quarter of a mile long on each side.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In McMoneagle’s first session against the target, Atwater gave him only the building’s geographical coordinates, which obviously described a place close to the Arctic Circle. McMoneagle sensed himself in an unpleasantly cold place, on a hill or mountain stretching over a wide area. Atwater was not too impressed, but he gave the remote viewer another chance a day or so later. This time McMoneagle saw large buildings, smokestacks, and nearby a semi-frozen sea.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater now decided to give McMoneagle feedback, to encourage him to go further. He showed him the satellite photo, and asked him to penetrate the building Jake Stewart had specified. McMoneagle went down into his trance, and was quickly inside the building. It was a noisy place. The interior seemed to be layered, with large slabs or scaffolds everywhere. There were girders, and flashing blue <a></a>white lights—the arcs of welding torches, he decided. After the session, sitting up awake, he sketched what he had seen.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A day or so later, Atwater put McMoneagle through a third session. This time, he saw more clearly what was inside the building. In one large area there was a submarine, apparently being repaired. In a second area there was a pile of construction materials. The third and largest area was what would interest the NSC the most. McMoneagle saw in it a very large submarine, still being constructed. “This sucker is big,” he murmured, and now he realized that it was the largest object in the building.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle described its tail, a very long and flat aft deck, a conning tower, and a line of paired missile tubes, unusually canted at angles away from vertical. “How many tubes do you see?” asked Atwater. But counting, or reading numbers or letters during remote viewing, was as hard as it was in dreams; it seemed to pull the mind out of its groove. Whenever McMoneagle tried to count like that, he would become lost after a few seconds. Instead, Atwater let him come out of his trance, and McMoneagle sketched what he had seen. He decided from his sketch that there had been either nine or ten pairs of tubes; in other words, the sub would carry eighteen or twenty missiles.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle—along with Hartleigh Trent, who also accessed the target—went on to describe a new type of drive mechanism in the submarine, an unusual double hull, and details of the special welding techniques the Soviets were using.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Back at the National Security Council, there was a certain amount of scoffing over these results. Aside from the fact that they came from psychics, the data described what would be the largest submarine then in existence. It seemed unlikely that the intelligence community would have known nothing about it before now.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Still, Jake Stewart followed up his request by asking Atwater to find out when the big sub would be launched <a></a>from its factory. Atwater went back to McMoneagle, and stepped him forward in time, month by month. It wasn’t obvious how the Soviets would ever launch the sub, because the building where it was being constructed was actually inland a hundred yards or so. But as the months rolled by in McMoneagle’s mind’s eye, he saw a new type of construction taking place. The Soviets were dynamiting and bulldozing a path from the edge of the submarine factory to the sea. Sometime in month number four, the sub floated down this artificial channel, later proceeding to sea trials.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The new information was passed to Stewart and the NSC, and it turned out that McMoneagle’s prediction hadn’t been far from the mark at all. Satellite photos taken in January 1980, about four months from McMoneagle’s last session, showed the massive new submarine—<em class="calibre4">Typhoon</em>, its class was soon dubbed by NATO—resting at dockside. It had twenty canted tubes for ballistic missiles and a large, flat aft deck. Next to it was the smaller submarine that had been in for repairs, an <em class="calibre4">Oscar</em> heavy attack sub.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The case sparked a lively debate inside the National Security Council, over the value of remote viewing. Some, like Robert Gates, a young Soviet analyst on loan from the CIA, were flatly skeptical, dismissing the data as sketchy or trivial, or unverifiable, or a lucky guess. Others, like Jake Stewart, were believers; as far as they were concerned, Joe McMoneagle—Viewer 518—was a valuable national asset, as close to the psychic “perfect spy” as America was likely to get.</p>

<p id="filepos169848" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos136242">*</a> In a 1994 article about secret U.S. purchases of Soviet arms via Eastern Europe, <em class="calibre4">The Washington Post</em> reporter Ben Weiser noted that the purchases began through Romania in the late 1970s, with the cooperation of the Romanian defense minister. Later, Poland became the main conduit. Weiser strongly implied that General Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, notorious for imposing martial law on his country in 1981, had known about and approved these transactions, although Jaruzelski denied this to Weiser in an interview. A former senior Pentagon official, who didn’t want to be quoted or directly identified, told me that in his opinion, Jaruzelski had been a U.S. agent.</p>
<p id="filepos170629" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos137082">*</a> Riley believes that the targeting envelope, for the first day of the operation, contained cashier’s checks destined for the payment of the tank’s seller. But Atwater doesn’t remember that part, and a Pentagon source with extensive experience in such operations told me that a simple transfer of cash or cashier’s checks was “not how those transactions were ever done.” More likely, he said, the money was wired to a Swiss bank account, for collection by the seller when the transaction had been completed successfully.</p>
