The job hadn’t been a cover for his CIA work. He had actually worked for the enterprise. Unfortunately it hadn’t made him an enormous amount of money, and it hadn’t been very glamorous. One day, in a burst of largesse, Price had offered to fly Ken Kress, Richard Kennett, and some other CIA officials out to West Virginia, using the corporate plane he said he had at his disposal. The officials dutifully turned up at Dulles Airport outside Washington, looking for a Learjet with Price’s coal company’s logo on the side. Instead they were directed to a small propeller plane, apparently chartered for the occasion. Out in Huntington, at the coal company headquarters, they found a group of trailers on a muddy hillside.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price himself bought some land out in West Virginia, apparently having remote-viewed large coal deposits beneath. The land did turn out to be rich with coal, and if <a id="filepos412749"></a>Price didn’t have enough money to fund the SRI program single-handedly, he at least had money to live on. He planned to move back to California, to rejoin the SRI program and to keep up his contacts with the CIA.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In mid-July of that year Price set out from Huntington on a several-week trip west. He stopped off first in Washington, then flew to Utah for a brief visit with his son. Then he went on to <a id="filepos413238"></a>Las Vegas. He loved gambling in Vegas, and though he was never fortunate enough to clean out the house, it seemed that he usually ended up with at least a small pile of winnings. He planned to go on from Las Vegas, after a few days, to SRI and the Bay Area, and then to visit his wife, Ann, who was living down in Los Angeles and working as a nurse.<a id="filepos413595" href="#filepos436309">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">In Los Angeles, Price had decided, he was finally going to get some serious medical attention. He had been feeling less and less healthy since he’d left SRI, and now he seemed to be getting much worse. During his medical evaluation at SRI, a year or so before, his electrocardiograms had suggested advanced coronary artery disease. The doctors at the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, along with Richard Kennett and Hal Puthoff and Ken Kress and others at SRI and CIA, had tried to get him to cut down on his eating and his drinking—and his smoking, which still amounted to two and a half packs of cigarettes a day. He had shrugged them off the way he often shrugged off adverse news, but now the attacks of angina pain were coming more frequently. He was only fifty-six years old, but he could easily have passed for seventy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In Las Vegas Price was accompanied by an old friend named Bill Alvarez, and his wife, Judy. The three checked into the Stardust Hotel, rested, and went into the restaurant for dinner. At dinner Price complained that he wasn’t feeling <a id="filepos414866"></a>good. According to a story Alvarez would later tell, Price now mentioned that at dinner in Washington the night before, someone had seemed to slip something into his coffee. He seemed serious about it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price soon felt so bad that he went upstairs to his room. He lay down, felt worse, and called the Alvarezes. They came to the room and found Price on the bed, in cardiac arrest. Alvarez called paramedics, who tried to resuscitate Price with defibrillator paddles. They couldn’t, and Price was declared dead in the local hospital’s emergency room.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">From there the story became stranger. When Richard Kennett and others tried to find out what had happened, they learned that no autopsy had been performed. For deaths in the hospital from well-understood causes, autopsies were often waived—but for deaths outside the hospital, when the deceased was from out of town, autopsies were the norm. To Kennett, the lack of an autopsy raised questions. But inquirers were merely told that a friend of Price—not Alvarez—had turned up with a briefcase full of his medical records. These, and the statements of the emergency room physician, had apparently been enough to convince Las Vegas medical officials to waive an autopsy and declare Price dead of a heart attack. Kennett tried to track down this mysterious person with the briefcase, but never found out who he was, or whether he even existed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price’s death gave birth to a flock of rumors and whispered questions. Was the man with the briefcase someone from the CIA? Why had he prevented an autopsy? What had he feared the pathologist would discover? Was Price even dead? Was he living somewhere under some new identity, as the perfect, untraceable spy?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Or had he been murdered by the Soviets? Price, like Swann, had long seemed concerned about this kind of thing, however paranoid such a concern might have seemed. Perhaps the man with the briefcase had wanted to prevent the pathologist from stumbling onto a KGB assassination <a id="filepos417179"></a>plot, with all the furor that would entail. Or perhaps this man with the briefcase was merely the invention of the medical examiner, who was under orders from the FBI to leave Price’s autopsy to a more specialized group of pathologists, trained to search for the most subtle toxins and poisons.<a id="filepos417488" href="#filepos436482">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Adding to this ripe stew of speculation was Bill Alvarez, who told everyone the story he said Price had told him, about the drug in Price’s coffee in Washington. Then another friend of Price’s stepped forward and said he’d had a vision, much more vivid than a dream, in which Price’s ghost appeared to him, like the ghost of Hamlet’s father, and complained that he’d been poisoned. Unfortunately, the remote viewer’s ghost failed to point the finger at anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For many who knew Pat Price, and were aware of his severe heart disease, there was no real mystery here. Yet in the decades to come, within the small community of the remote-viewing program, Price’s untimely death would have, so to speak, a life of its own. Virtually every possible scenario, every reason for Price’s suffering and demise, would be constructed and pondered. Theories would rise and fall. But in the end, few were willing to believe anything too strongly. As late as 1994, Russell Targ would tell me, “I don’t know how Pat Price died.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Whatever had really happened to Price, it was clear that the Soviets were still competing intensely for the psychic high ground. They had dozens of facilities dedicated to psi research, <a id="filepos419038"></a>many of them staffed by widely respected scientists. Leningrad University’s Leonid Vasiliev had retired now, but his laboratory continued its work under a successor, Pavel Gulayev. A Dr. Lev Lupichev headed a psi research center called the Institute of Control Problems, attached to the USSR Academy of Sciences. In the vast, cold “Science City” in Novosibirsk, under the direction of a Navy colonel named Vitali Perov, there was reportedly something called Special Department No. 8, which carried out a secret program of military-oriented psi work. In Moscow, hush-hush psi research also went on in a well-guarded facility called the Institute for the Problems of Information Transmission (IPPI) and at a laboratory in the Pavlov “Institute of Higher Nervous Activity.” And of course there was I. M. Kogan’s old psi laboratory at the Popov Society, which was said to have moved to, and expanded in, a new and secret location. Kogan’s employee Eduard Naumov, who had always seemed a bit too free with the psi research gossip, was sentenced to two years’ hard labor in 1974, ostensibly because he had charged lecture fees without permission. Western psi researchers assumed that Soviet officials simply wanted to keep Naumov on a tighter leash.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By this time, the mid-1970s, the Soviets had apparently embarked upon a society-wide screening program for talented psychics, covering high schools, universities, and Red Army recruits. The KGB and the military intelligence agencies were after the best natural clairvoyants, the best psychokinetic savants, the best all-around visionaries and wonder-workers that the mystical races of the Russian Empire could produce.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And they got them, if one could believe the scattered reports filtering out from spies, defectors, émigrés, and the general rumor mill. There was talk, for example, of a <a id="filepos421093"></a>Central Asian woman, a licensed physician, who was the Russian Empire’s answer to Pat Price. It was said she could <a id="filepos421223"></a>remote-view secret military installations in detail, from hundreds and presumably thousands of miles away.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were stories of cosmonauts trained to use telepathy as an emergency communications system. There were tales of the “extrasensors” from IPPI who could psychically tap into otherwise secure communications links and into the minds of important foreigners. One savant on loan from IPPI reportedly enabled a Soviet Army unit, during military exercises, to anticipate its opponents’ movements and lay a successful ambush.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Czechs and Bulgarians were said to have similar, if smaller, programs. For example, a blind <a id="filepos422021"></a>Bulgarian seeress named Vanga Dimitrova was openly employed by the state, and even had two secretaries.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ironically, despite the rich esoteric traditions of the Slavonic world, theories for psi in these countries had to bow first to Communist ideology, which promoted “scientific materialism” and rejected any “idealism” or “superstition.” As recently as 1956 the <em class="calibre4">Soviet Encyclopedia</em> had scowlingly defined ESP as “an anti-social idealist fiction about man’s supernatural power to perceive phenomena which, considering the time and the place, cannot be perceived.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were still some of those negative vibrations in the air during the Brezhnev era. One didn’t want to get too far out of line. Brezhnev and the top ranks of the Soviet nomenklatura regularly availed themselves of the services of shapely Dzhuna Davitashvili, a Georgian healer, and sundry other seers and mystagogues. But outside the protected ranks of the nomenklatura, researchers had to be more careful. Their terminology was often deliberately anti-mystical. They spoke of <em class="calibre4">transmission</em> and <em class="calibre4">reception</em> of psi information. I. M. Kogan argued that telepathy was nothing more than communication via extremely-low <a></a>frequency (ELF) radio waves in the 10 Hz region.<a id="filepos423503" href="#filepos437007">*</a> This, he said, corresponded to the “alpha” brain wave frequency that was so prominent on electroencephalographs. Kogan hypothesized that these low-frequency signals were produced by the sender’s brain and sensed by the receiver’s brain. Other Russian researchers even spoke of “psi particles,” as if psi, like electromagnetic phenomena, behaved with wave-particle duality.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">It all sounded very dry and scientific. But if émigrés and the rumor mill could be believed, East bloc psi research was also very <a id="filepos424185"></a>brutal and sinister. When one read of the things that some of these scientists were supposedly doing, one could almost see—in grainy black and white, with a chamber of horrors pipe organ playing in the background—the grinning faces of the Russian researchers and their hunchbacked henchmen, as they inflicted pain and suffering on their howling subjects, and plotted a hellish conquest of the world. One experiment, according to a story told by Eduard Naumov, involved a group of baby rabbits on board a submarine. Their mother, with electrodes planted deep in her brain, sat in a laboratory onshore. It was yet another <em class="calibre4">Nautilus-style</em> telepathy attempt, but this time with a sadistic twist. At a prearranged time researchers on the submarine killed the baby rabbits … snapping their necks, one by one … while onshore, researchers tried to detect any unusual activity in the mother rabbit’s brain.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At Special Department No. 8, according to an émigré physicist named August Stern, the same sort of experiment was tried, but with a mother cat and her newborn kittens—which were tortured with electroshocks. It was said that even <a id="filepos425484"></a>human subjects received brutal treatment, with overdoses <a id="filepos425549"></a>of stimulants like Adrenalin, and depressants like phenobarbitol, and electrical shocks, and high-strength magnetic fields, all in an effort to induce hypnotic or otherwise psi-conducive states. Rumor had it that some died, and others were brain-damaged.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Some of the reports of Soviet “remote-influencing” experiments made clear what the Russians intended to do with psi if they ever perfected it. A Leningrad woman named Nina Kulagina, for example, was reported to have remotely stopped the beating heart of a frog. As for her power over humans, it was said that she once used her psychokinetic “whammy” to induce tachycardia—an abnormally rapid heart rate—in a skeptical psychiatrist. Dread Nina, it was claimed, was also able to cause severe burning sensations in people, including at least one visiting Western researcher, just by touching them.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">According to émigrés and intelligence reports, the KGB and GRU (military intelligence) had scoured the mystical eastern vastnesses of the Soviet Union in order to find the toughest Siberian shamans, the best-trained Tibetan priests, the most powerful Mongolian <em class="calibre4">chi gong</em> masters. At Special Department No. 8 in Siberia, according to August Stern, shamans tried to use their PK powers to make people fall off streetcars, or to kill small animals. An émigré parapsychologist named Larissa Vilenskaya claimed that at I.M. Kogan’s lab she was once shown a film of a PK master listening to a foreign politician on the radio, and trying to send detrimental psi particles his way.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At IPPI one day, it was said, a group of Tibetans succeeded in breaking a human skull a few yards away, just by concentrating on it. Also at IPPI, and at a laboratory in Kazakhstan, shamans took madryushka dolls, hand-carved wooden spoons, souvenir models of Sputnik—the usual beriozka store trinkets—and zapped them with evil psi energies. The gifts now supposedly emitted debilitating rays, almost as if they had been impregnated with some kind of <a></a>radioactive material; they were given to hapless foreign visitors, who would thereafter, it was believed, suffer neuralgia, depression, even nervous breakdowns. It was black magic, pure and simple, cloaked in the gray vernacular of psi particles and psi radiation and transmission and reception. Lev Lupichev, from the Institute of Control Problems, and a fellow named Boris Ivanov, at the “Laboratory of Bio-Information,” even claimed to have perfected “batteries” that could store and discharge these negative vibrations—or negative particles, or whatever one was supposed to call them.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were still <a id="filepos428567"></a>wilder stories, all presumably apocryphal, such as the one about the medicine man someone had found who was incredibly powerful, could stop the heart of a small animal a mile away, yet, like a wild fast-baller, had an occasional problem with control. They sent him against a rat in a cage and he ended up killing one of the researchers. And then there was the one about the fellow who was supposed to stop the heart of some poor human subject in the next room, a convicted criminal who had involuntarily donated his living body to science. The shaman or whoever he was wound up and sent his psi energies flying, and sure enough, the convict’s heart stopped cold—but so did the shaman’s.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Because Soviet researchers often thought of psi phenomena as being mediated by electromagnetic radiation, they eventually thought of building <a id="filepos429495"></a>psi machines. One idea had to do with a remote-influencing, or “mind control,” device built from a simple low-frequency radio transmitter that had been tuned to the proper nervous-system frequencies.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the mid-1970s the CIA and DIA had begun to receive various reports of “psychotronic generators” being designed and built along these lines. There was one device that supposedly could cause strokes or heart attacks. Another gave people a sensation of anxiety, or of a disorienting <a id="filepos430086"></a>blow to the head. Another made them aggressive, or drove them mad. Some reports credited a Russian scientist named Viktor Inyushin with the development of this technology. Others cited a Czech engineer named Robert Pavlita. An émigré named Nikolai Khokhlov, apparently a former KGB officer, claimed that his erstwhile employers had “tested” such generators against certain selected communities in North America.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Many in the U.S. intelligence community simply regarded these stories as evidence that the Russian psi program was spiraling off into insanity. “The greatest threat,” one senior CIA official would later say, “was that they would <em class="calibre4">stop</em> wasting money on this!”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There seemed little chance of that; Soviet enthusiasm for far-fetched weaponry reached all the way to the top. In a strange speech delivered in June of 1975, according to <em class="calibre4">The New York Times:</em></p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, urged the United States to agree on a ban of research and development of new kinds of weapons “more terrible” than anything the world has known. American arms control negotiators have tried to find out from their Soviet counterparts what he had in mind, but they have not learned anything more than that he meant “some kind of rays,” according to United States officials.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2">Aside from doing their own psi research, which seemed to be extensive and well funded, the Soviets tried to obtain information about American efforts in this area, including the work at SRI.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ and their friends in the government knew that the Soviets were interested in the SRI research, and were understandably concerned that the Soviets might recruit psychics to infiltrate the SRI program. But the grasping hand of Soviet espionage seemed less subtle than <a id="filepos432379"></a>that. In early 1976, for example, after Puthoff and Targ had published a number of their experiments in <em class="calibre4">Proceedings of the IEEE</em>, they began a long wrangle with the editors of the journal’s Soviet edition.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the normal course of events, the Puthoff and Targ article would have appeared in the Soviet edition without much if any correspondence between authors and editors. However, in this case, the Soviet editors insisted that they wouldn’t publish the article unless Puthoff and Targ provided further details of the SRI experiments. They sent the two researchers a long list of questions they wanted answered: How fine was the detail that remote viewers could perceive? How did SRI manage to find people who were good remote viewers? Did they use drugs, or hypnosis, or some other technique to bring about psi-conducive states of consciousness? Did they know of any way to shield targets from remote viewers? Puthoff and Targ refused to respond to the list of questions, and forwarded the list to their government sponsors in Washington. The article was eventually published anyway, but several years later, Soviet parapsychologist Larissa Vilenskaya emigrated to the United States and told Western researchers that the whole thing had indeed been a hamfisted KGB intelligence-gathering ploy. She knew, she said, because she had been the one forced to write the list of questions.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day another Soviet request came in to SRI, this time from the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco. A cosmonaut named Vitali Sevastyanov was in town and wanted to talk to Puthoff and Targ about some psychic experiences he’d had. He would be accompanied by Soviet parapsychologist Lev Lupichev and by the local vice-consul, Oleg Sidorenko.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and the rest of SRI officialdom accepted the request, but were warned by CIA and SRI security officials, in case they weren’t already aware, that the visit probably wasn’t as innocent as it sounded. The three Russians got no farther than the SRI dining room, but they still managed to <a id="filepos434663"></a>pepper Puthoff and Targ with questions—more or less the same ones on the list from the Soviet <em class="calibre4">IEEE</em> editors. Puthoff and Targ fielded the questions as cleanly, or as uncleanly, as they could. Towards the end of the lunch they suggested that in the spirit of détente they should do an experiment: SRFs psychics would remote-view Lupichev’s lab, and Lupichev’s psychics could do the same to SRI. Lupichev seemed to like the idea, but Puthoff and Targ never heard from him again.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Of all Puthoff’s encounters with the Soviets, the strangest had to have been the one in Prague in the summer of 1973, at the First International Congress on Psychotronic Research. A group of well-known Soviet researchers had been due to appear at the conference, but at the last minute they had cancelled. In their place had come some other Soviets who were unknown on the psi scene but who nevertheless claimed to be psi researchers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There was just enough time to run the newcomers’ names past the CIA before Puthoff, with Swann, took off for Prague. Word came back that the leader of the Soviet group was a KGB officer. But when Puthoff and Swann got to the conference, it hardly seemed to matter who was KGB and who wasn’t. Almost everyone who came up to query them, whether Soviet or Eastern European, was reading off what seemed to be the same centrally prepared list of questions.</p>
