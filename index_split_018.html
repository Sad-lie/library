Can you find Soviet submarines? they would ask Swann and Price. Can you see into the future? Can you visit the past? Someone from the CIA even suggested that the two psychics should act as spirit mediums, transmitting the ethereal messages of foreign agents whose lives had been snuffed out before they had been able to deliver the goods to their American case officers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But most of the requests, in the years that followed, were tailored to Swann’s coordinate-based clairvoyance scheme, which he began to call scanning-by-coordinate, “Scanate” for short. Sometimes the coordinates would be mailed in, or telephoned in. More often they would be hand-carried <a></a>from Washington, by officials who would ensure that the coordinates were presented to Price, and to Swann, only at the moment they began their psychic performances.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The arrangement was in the nature of a promotional offer: SRF’s psychics would provide samples of their product free of charge, and their visitors—vetted to exclude mere curiosity seekers—would decide whether or not they wanted to pay for more of it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann and Price didn’t always know for whom they were demonstrating their psychic abilities, but they were always eager to perform well. They held out hope that their achievements would not be entombed in some obscure parapsychology journal, but instead would be used, ultimately, in support of the highest national goals. What with all the visitors from Washington, and top-secret target sites, they began to see themselves as super-spies, James Bonds of the Aquarian Age.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the idea that they were now Cold Warriors was not the only thing energizing Swann and Price—for they were also competing against each other. This was natural, considering that they practiced such an individualistic and esoteric discipline. In fact, one could have argued that they were more individualistic and esoteric than any ordinary spy or soldier, for in their own minds, at least, they ventured alone and naked, savants with extraordinary powers, against the howling darkness of the ethereal realm. They were up there with the great magicians and medicine men, seers and healers, shamans and sorcerers.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Scholars often quarrel about how to define particular variants of the visionary or “shamanic” personality, but from the literature it seems clear that all these types share a relative proneness to altered states of consciousness. In many cases, this trance-proneness appears to have genetic causes. Shamanic behavior often runs in families, in primitive cultures as well as our own, and the shamanic person in early <a id="filepos263172"></a>life may seem mentally unstable, “neurotic,” or “labile,” in extreme cases manifesting the symptoms of what we might now call epilepsy, hysteria, schizophrenia, or <a id="filepos263372"></a>dissociative disorders.<a id="filepos263403" href="#filepos289478">*</a> He may suffer seizures under stress. Sudden trances and fugues may make him oblivious of his surroundings, and may leave him wandering alone and amnesic, far from home. He may hear voices, see visions, have unnerving out-of-body experiences and confrontations with supernatural entities. He may claim a range of ailments—headaches, stomachaches, fatigue, miscellaneous wounds—that are imagined, feigned, or self-induced.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In other cases, this neuropsychological lability may develop out of such things as hormonal imbalances, near-terminal diseases, severe head injuries, and of course psychological stresses. The historian Mircea Eliade, citing the anthropologist Knud Rasmussen, has even noted that one Eskimo shaman “obtained his power after being struck by a ball of fire.” And the modern UFO lore contains numerous examples of people whose close encounters with “flying saucers” or other unidentified aerial phenomena appear to have bestowed upon them a trance-proneness similar to that seen in shamans.<a id="filepos264577" href="#filepos290454"><sup class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">†</span></sup></a>
<a id="filepos264664"></a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ingo Swann had never had a close encounter with a ball of fire or a flying saucer, and had never been mentally ill. Puthoff and others at SRI regarded him as a witty and clever man with a daring, inquisitive mind. But there were otherworldly, vaguely shamanic themes running throughout his life story. Swann would say, for example, that a great-grandmother on his mother’s side was a Sioux Indian medicine woman, and that his own childhood had been haunted by a variety of paranormal experiences. His general fascination with the occult had led him to an exploration of various alternative or New Ageish disciplines, and his worldview, despite a modern gloss, featured many exotic motifs. Swann considered himself an accomplished astrologer, believed that his soul had once belonged to an eighth-century European,<a id="filepos265565" href="#filepos290780">*</a> and was deeply interested in UFOs and the idea that aliens were visiting planet Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To most of the government people visiting SRI, it probably seemed that there was nothing even remotely shamanic about Pat Price, except for his mysterious psychic abilities. Puthoff and Targ touted him as “a former police commissioner,” a rock of conventionality. Now in semi-retirement, so the story went, he was just a businessman, an ordinary joe who liked to play poker and go fishing on the weekends.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In fact, Price was in some ways even more shamanic than Swann. Not only did he have out-of-body experiences and a history of alternative religious leanings, but he also claimed the ancient—and now somewhat quaint—shamanic power of being able to change the weather, creating <a id="filepos266557"></a>or evaporating clouds at will. Furthermore, he believed that he could make traffic lights change through psychokinesis, and that his soul had once belonged to the American colonial orator Patrick Henry. Last but not least, he believed that an alien civilization flew its silvery saucers into bases on the moon and Mars—and also here on Earth, under the oceans and beneath great mountains. Not long after arriving at SRI, he reported to Puthoff that Alaska’s Mount Hayes, the jewel of a glacial range northeast of Anchorage, housed one of the aliens’ largest bases.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Paranormal competitions have always been a great pastime of shamanic types. Often waged like athletic bouts, they are found throughout the lore of religion and magic—for example, Moses’s duels with the Pharaoh’s sorcerers—as well as in more recent writings on the subject. The ethnologist Holger Kalweit gives an example from the Washo Indians of North America, among whom shamans stage competitions to see who has the greatest power. “One form of their competition consists in seeing who can knock over the greatest number of poles, which are tightly rammed into the earth in a line, merely by pointing at them.” Another form of competition, presumably, is the telling of tall tales to wide-eyed ethnologists. But whether in legend or in reality, shamans have often seemed preoccupied with battling it out amongst themselves. Mircea Eliade refers to the “intense rivalry” of their contests.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A similar form of contest now seemed to take hold at SRI, the goal being to spy psychically upon targets in the most dramatic and convincing detail. For each session, Swann or Price would sit down at a table with a stack of blank paper and a pen. The psychic would begin by writing on his top sheet of paper the date, the time, and his special <a id="filepos268585"></a>three-digit code number. Puthoff had introduced the code numbers. The idea was to help keep things as sanitized and anonymous as possible, not only for scientific and security <a id="filepos268769"></a>reasons, but—perhaps in vain—to help dampen any personal rivalries among his psychics.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When given a set of coordinates, Swann or Price would write them down, and then would start talking, or writing, or sketching whatever came to mind. Puthoff or Targ, acting as the session monitor, would prompt with questions: What’s that right there? Can you elaborate? What does this look like from up close? Eventually, the sketches and descriptions would be analyzed and summarized, and delivered to the prospective client.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In late July of 1973, Richard Kennett telephoned Hal Puthoff with the coordinates 49°20′s, 70°14′E. Puthoff walked into the “Scanate” room, sat down, and read them to Swann.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann’s first impressions of the target left him confused. He seemed to be out in open ocean. Was it some kind of trick target? He wasn’t sure what he should do.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Is there anything nearby?” asked Puthoff.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann sensed a landmass nearby, and decided to go with that. “My initial response,” he told Puthoff, “is that it’s an island, maybe a mountain sticking up through a cloud cover. Terrain seems rocky. Must be some sort of small plants growing there. Cloud bank to the west. Very cold. I see some buildings rather mathematically laid out. One of them is orange. There is something like a radar antenna, a round disc … Two white cylindrical tanks, quite large. To the northwest, a small airstrip. Wind is blowing. Must be two or three trucks in front of building …”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff seemed happy with that, but Swann wanted to press on. His mind’s eye was filled with coastal vistas, so much so that he felt he could map the island accurately. “If I look to the west, hills; to the north, flatlands, and I think, airstrip and ocean in the distance to the east; can’t see anything to the south. I move to the coastline and follow it around …” He began to sketch the outline of the island <a id="filepos271279"></a>on a blank sheet of paper, but it wasn’t anything like conscious artistry. His autonomic nervous system had taken over, and it wanted more space. Swann’s pen began to move around as if the paper weren’t even there, and when it reached the edge of one sheet of paper Puthoff would hurriedly put down a new sheet so the pen could continue to trace. All the while Swann kept up a commentary about what he was sensing at that part of the coastline. One place there were birds everywhere, and bird dung, and the guano smell seemed to fill his nostrils. Another place there were rocks and breakers and the smell of sea spray. There were buildings, boats, a wharf, bays, mountains, promontories, and beaches.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After a while Swann had completed a rough drawing of the island, adding features according to his commentary. He and Puthoff Scotch-taped the sheets together and sent them to Kennett. The coordinates, it turned out, described a point within a small bay on the eastern side of remote Kerguelen Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Owned by France, Kerguelen was the site of a joint French-Soviet “upper atmospheric meteorological research facility,” rumored to double, at least for the Soviets, as some kind of secret listening post or missile-tracking station. Swann had not only described its outline fairly accurately, he had accurately placed and described many other features not even available on the few maps of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were claps on the back for Swann, and Puthoff and Targ promoted the event in meetings with various intelligence officials in Washington. But Price didn’t seem too impressed. One day, Puthoff handed him his own set of coordinates—“sexy” coordinates, as the classified ones would soon come to be known.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price wasn’t aware of it, but a month or so before, at CIA headquarters, Puthoff and Targ had briefed senior CIA officials on their research. The officials included Office of Technical Service chief John McMahon, and his boss, Deputy <a id="filepos273546"></a>Director for Science and Technology Carl Duckett. The Agency officials had suggested that the time was ripe for psychic spying on more sensitive targets overseas.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The coordinates Price was given described the location of a mysterious Soviet military research facility at the southern edge of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test area in the Kazakh Republic. The target’s CIA nickname was URDF-3—for “unidentified R&amp;D facility” number 3. Air Force intelligence called it P-NUTS, for “probable nuclear underground test site.” No one in the U.S. intelligence community really knew what went on there. The CIA officials who brought in the coordinates, an Office of Technical Service engineer, Ken Kress,<a id="filepos274368" href="#filepos291359">*</a> and a physicist named Peter Maris, told Puthoff and Targ that the site was “a research facility.” That was about all Kress and Maris knew, too.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price did the session from within an electrically shielded room on the second floor of SRI’s Radio Physics Building.<a id="filepos274774" href="#filepos291515"><sup class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">†</span></sup></a> Targ, serving as his monitor, turned on a tape recorder, said a few words in preamble, and then read Price the coordinates of the site, explaining that it was some kind of research facility. Price polished his glasses with a handkerchief, closed his eyes, and leaned back in his chair. After a minute or so, he said, “This reminds me of the old joke that starts with a guy in his penthouse looking up at the Third Avenue El.” In his clairvoyant reverie, he explained, he was lying on his back, in warm sunshine, on the roof of a several-story building. But towering over him—straddling the building, in fact—was a large crane. “As I drift up in the air and look down, it seems to be riding on a track <a></a>with one rail on each side of the building. I’ve never seen anything like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The wheeled crane, said Price, was being used to move large, heavy objects in and around a semi-underground facility. The wheels on the crane were each twice the height of a man. Near the crane were several other buildings, and a cluster of tall compressed-gas canisters.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ken Kress and Peter Maris, when they first heard Price’s description of the Semipalatinsk site, didn’t know what to make of it. But back in Washington, they checked with colleagues and found a recent satellite photo of the site—and there was the crane on rails, and the building between the rails, just as Price had described them.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Meanwhile, guided by Puthoff and Targ, Price periodically returned to the site at Semipalatinsk, describing additional details. He sketched a layout of the site, with a river nearby to the north. Then he went inside the low building under the crane, into a room where large curved sections—“gores”—of steel were lying around. Workers were trying to weld them into sixty-foot-diameter spheres, said Price. But the steel was so thick that the workers were having difficulty welding them together, and were experimenting with new welding techniques.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At some point, within a week or so of his first session against the site, Price met directly with Kress and Maris. They now explained that they were from the CIA, and that his description of the crane was substantially accurate. Questioned by the two Agency officers, Price explored the site further. Two weeks after his initial session with Targ, he had filled several hours’ worth of cassette tapes, plus a large sketchbook. It seemed from the data that the Semipalatinsk facility would soon be conducting controlled explosions of some kind. The metal spheres were to be used to contain the explosions.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Aside from the sketch of the crane, and the general layout of the site, there was little that Kress and Maris could <a></a>confirm. But the sketch of the crane was on its own extremely impressive. The correspondence between it and the relevant satellite photo of the site was so close that merely by showing those two images side by side, in briefings for senior intelligence officials, Puthoff and Targ would ensure SRI’s psi research funding for the next several years.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As for the large metal spheres, a U.S. satellite caught them out in the open, in completed form, sometime in late 1974 or early 1975. Photo analysts estimated them to be about sixty feet in diameter.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The existence of the spheres would touch off a wild debate within the American intelligence community. Air Force intelligence officials would argue that the spheres were to be used to contain low-yield nuclear explosions, which in turn would drive an advanced proton-beam weapon that could shoot down U.S. aircraft and missiles. This idea was eventually leaked to a reporter at the magazine <em class="calibre4">Aviation Week</em>, which in May 1977 ran an alarming, eight-thousand-word article on Semipalatinsk and other supposed beam-weapons sites:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<p class="calibre_25"><span><span class="calibre13">SOVIETS PUSH FOR BEAM WEAPON</span></span></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre2"> <p class="calibre_21">… The Semipalatinsk facility where beams weapons tests are taking place has been under observation by the US for about 10 years. The central building at the facility is believed by some officials to contain a collective accelerator, electron injectors, and power stores.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">The building is 200 ft. wide and 700 ft. long, with walls of reinforced concrete 10-ft. thick.… [The test site] is surrounded by a series of security fences.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">The US used high-resolution photographic reconnaissance satellites to watch as the Soviet technicians had four holes dug through solid granite formations not far from the main large building at the facility. Mine heads were constructed over each opening, and frames were built over the holes. As tons of rock were removed, a <a></a>large underground chamber was built deep inside the rock formation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">In a nearby building, huge, extremely thick steel gores were manufactured. The building has since been removed. These steel segments were parts of a large sphere estimated to be about 18 meters (57.8 ft.) in diameter. Enough gores for two complete spheres were constructed. US officials believe the spheres are needed to capture and store energy from nuclear-driven explosives or pulse-power generators. The steel gores are believed by some officials to be among the earliest clues to what might be taking place at the facility.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">The components were moved to the nearby mine heads and lowered into the chamber.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">The Air Force hypothesis fell on deaf ears at the CIA, where in-house physicists and consultants scoffed at the beam-weapons idea, suggesting that the spheres might merely contain nuclear waste, or perhaps conventional explosions that would be used to experiment with advanced pulse-power technologies.<a id="filepos281783" href="#filepos291994">*</a> But both the CIA and the Air Force would agree that the spheres were there, and that the Soviets had devised an ingenious new “flux-welding” technique to put them together. On both those counts Pat Price had been right, and he had described the spheres and the special welding techniques before <em class="calibre4">anyone in the United States knew they existed</em>. To Puthoff and Targ, that made it just about the best test of psychic spying they could imagine.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a id="filepos282458"></a>Pat Price was so good, it seemed, that he could do psychic spying virtually in his sleep, without coordinates, and without even being asked to look for anything. He would lie in bed at night and drift around the globe, his psi faculties primed for whatever big events were happening or about to happen. On one occasion, he told Puthoff he had seen a school of Russian submarines out in the Pacific, moving around in a strange parallelogram pattern. Puthoff made some phone calls, and soon confirmed Price’s report. In the autumn of 1973, according to Puthoff, Price saw the Yom Kippur war coming, and saw it going, predicting the ceasefire date a few weeks in advance.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Another time, Price came into the office at SRI and declared that President Nixon had a device in his office that was going to make him suffer. Puthoff wondered what the hell this meant. Had the Russians smuggled something into the Oval Office—some awful toxin, or perhaps a mind-warping microwave source? Puthoff dutifully passed the information on to Ken Kress at the CIA. Whether Kress in turn passed it on to the White House, Puthoff never knew, but months later, as Watergate ground to its conclusion, he heard about Nixon’s Oval Office tape recorder, and decided that that had probably been what Price had detected.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Price seldom knew how he did it. He just did it. Swann, on the other hand, was interested in how it all worked, and he liked to define and name the various parts and modes of psi functioning. <em class="calibre4">Scanate</em> was just one of the new terms he had invented; there was also <em class="calibre4">Scanex</em>, for <em class="calibre4">scan</em>ning-<em class="calibre4">ex</em>tended, which referred to the eyes-closed altered-state form of psychic spying that Price, for example, used in his nocturnal jaunts. The viewer in Scanex mode could perform an open search for anything interesting, as Price liked to do, or, like Swann, he could attempt to find the unknown loca <a id="filepos284536"></a>tion of some known target—for example hidden nuclear missiles, or some important person.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But if Swann was adept at providing insights into his psychic excursions, Price was simply a better psychic. He wasn’t perfect—he had bad days like anyone else—but to Hal Puthoff and Richard Kennett and Ken Kress and the others he worked with, he seemed more accurate, more consistent, and more attuned to the technical details of target sites. On the whole, he could pick up more data. One of the most promising things about him was that he seemed able to pick up not only visual and other sensory data, but also alphanumeric data, words and numbers. Swann, by contrast, would be able to pull accurate alphanumeric information from a target only two or three times in his life, and always in visual rather than verbal form, not recognizing at first that the shapes he drew belonged to an alphabet. Swann, like Puthoff and Targ, took the view that if one tried psychically to recognize a number or a letter or a word, even while unconscious of the fact, the perceptual process tended to short-circuit. One would shift away from the deeper, more basic parts of the brain, where psi processing seemed to occur, and would engage the left cortex, where the bulk of the verbal and analytical apparatus resided. In other words the psi process, by its very attempt to recognize alphanumeric data, would shut itself off.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Well, to Pat Price that was a very interesting theory, and it sounded reasonable. But it didn’t stop him at all. When he was going after a target, he could often read numbers or words on pieces of paper, or names on uniforms, as at the NSA site in West Virginia. It wasn’t easy, and he wasn’t always right, but it could be done. When it came to raw shamanic prowess, Price was in a league of his own.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There was another difference between Swann and Price, perhaps widened by Price’s amazing feats in the psychic spying room. Swann’s ego seemed more fragile, his demeanor more pedantic. He could be great fun one minute, <a id="filepos286844"></a>the life of the party, but if the proper respect were not paid, if a word in jest went amiss, if an obstacle were placed in his path, he could quickly become ill tempered. Never completely at home in the world, ever beset by a confederacy of dunces, he was, to some, a perpetual storm waiting to break.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price, by contrast, seemed an endless sunny day. He did not worry over the design of experiments. He did not mind the secrecy concerns that occasionally prevented him from knowing how well he had done. He ignored the inconveniences that might have sent other psychics into a stupor of resentment, and he never threatened to leave SRI, as Swann often did. His cheerful emotional resilience, his “rough and ready” demeanor, as Puthoff would later describe it, charmed just about everyone he met. To Puthoff and Targ and the CIA people, he seemed like the ideal psychic subject.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Pat Price did not, however, charm Ingo Swann, who came to regard him as a “<a id="filepos287971"></a>manipulator,” and treated him somewhat coolly—on the increasingly rare occasions that they were within speaking range. In fact, toward the end of his first eight-month contract at SRI, Swann was usually absent from Menlo Park, busy instead doing parapsychological experiments elsewhere, or trying to sell his psychic services to oil companies, or working on half a dozen other projects in New York and around the country. Swann must have been bitterly aware of the irony. He had succeeded dramatically in his task at SRI, turning around what might have been a dismal failure of a research program. He had isolated a psi phenomenon robust enough to be replicated, and perhaps even to be used operationally. Despite all this, he had already begun to slip into obsolescence. Pat Price, and not he, now seemed to be the favorite of both SRI and the sponsors in Washington.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When Swann’s contract at SRI ended in mid-August of 1973, he was handed a small plaque, commemorating his <a id="filepos289047"></a>contribution to the SRI research program. Puthoff, driving him to the airport, gave him a pep talk about all they had accomplished, and all they would accomplish in the future, once the money really started to roll in.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Swann angrily vowed that he would never return to SRI.</p>
<div border="1" class="calibre_24"><div class="calibre3">
<p id="filepos289478" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos263403">*</a> Dissociative disorders include persistent or recurrent amnesias, fugue or trance states, feelings of unreality, spirit-possession syndromes, and the modern, medicalized version of spirit-possession, known as multiple personality disorder. These disorders are named for the psychiatric term <em class="calibre4">dissociation</em>, which refers (somewhat vaguely) to the splitting off of various mental processes from consciousness. For example, dissociative disorder sufferers often appear to be amnesic after dissociative episodes, as if their experience and behavior during those episodes were dissociated from normal consciousness and memory. They also can dissociate pain and other autonomic feedback mechanisms, and thus are capable of unusual physical feats—although the fantasy-proneness of many dissociative people also leads them to imagine or feign pain that isn’t there.</p>
<p id="filepos290454" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos264577">†</a> Some researchers have theorized that UFOs in such cases are geo-atmospheric phenomena associated with intense magnetic fields that can induce seizures, hallucinations, and even permanent neurological damage in nearby witnesses.</p>
<p id="filepos290780" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos265565">*</a> Swann told an interviewer in early 1973: “I recall a time in the past when people with paranormal abilities were appreciated. I was an adviser to a conqueror in Europe who had a great deal of faith in such people, and employed them as advisers. At that time it was very easy for me to read people’s minds. I would advise the conqueror or king what I felt were the true motivations of a person who came for an audience. I think that was in the eighth century.”</p>
<p id="filepos291359" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos274368">*</a> Kress had brought Puthoff the first CIA contract in 1972.</p>
<p id="filepos291515" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos274774">†</a> Such rooms were normally used to protect sensitive computing and telephone equipment. The grounded metal shielding in the walls blocked most electromagnetic radiation the equipment might emit, thus helping to protect it from would-be eavesdroppers. Shielded rooms were occasionally used by Puthoff and Targ to bolster their argument that psi was not an electromagnetic phenomenon.</p>
<p id="filepos291994" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos281783">*</a> The Soviets never did develop a workable beam-weapon, either at the Semipalatinsk site or anywhere else. A former Air Force intelligence source admitted that, in retrospect, it appeared that the site had been used not for beam-weapons development but for basic pulse-power generation experiments, using low-yield nuclear explosions. A CIA scientist familiar with the debate still scoffed at the idea that the spheres could have contained nuclear explosions rather than conventional high explosives.</p>
