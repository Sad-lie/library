<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It’s hard not to brag. It’s been over a year since I came home from New Zealand, and it’s been a year of astonishing good health. While I chelated, all my hope was pinned on one goal: getting myself back to the state of health I’d enjoyed right before I got my amalgams removed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">What I never expected, what I never dreamed possible, was that I would surpass that goal.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When I came home from that trip, I knew that I’d moved to a whole other level. Chelation, and my alarming cold-turkey reaction to quitting antioxidants, were behind me. I’d achieved a far more stable state of being. But what was this state like? What were the boundaries of my abilities now?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I knew I could hike and climb a mountain, but what else could I do? Could I run? I went to the gym and got on a treadmill and jogged for 20 minutes without a problem. Could I eat sugar? Was the candida gone? I experimented by eating a little maple syrup, and then trying out some chocolate. The candida rash I got was minimal, but it was still there. I was happy to see that my negative reaction to the caffeine had disappeared, it no longer kept me up at night to eat a little chocolate. But I decided to play it safe and still avoid sugar.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And the big question—could I eat gluten? I tried a handful of goldfish crackers, and found that I had the very mild neuropathy in my scalp and fingers just like last time. Even after a course of NAET, a kind of acupuncture specially designed to curb allergies, I still reacted to gluten in a very mild way. I decided to stay gluten free until my reaction disappeared completely.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My disappointment about my limitations was very short-lived because I had gained the most important thing of all. My brain was now permanently functional and fog-free, my emotions were balanced. My habitual, unconscious approach to life shifted to a place of contentment and optimism. I didn’t struggle with my emotions anymore. I felt calm most of the time, and when thorny emotional issues came up, I navigated them with aplomb.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This didn’t mean that I felt completely happy every moment. It was more that my emotional reactions to things stopped being weighted down by a load of mercury gloom. My negative feelings were now in proportion to the events that caused them, making them so much easier to manage.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And because my inner emotional landscape changed, my words and actions changed too. It wasn’t very dramatic, it wasn’t like I became a whole other person. But the way that I was responding to life now was something that I’d often seen in others, and had been frankly envious of. I found myself automatically acting like an emotionally resilient person, something I’d always tried to emulate, but had never experienced from the inside. I cried a lot less. I was harder to offend. I didn’t spend a lot of time fretting about what people ‘really meant’ if they made an odd comment about me. Everything was just easier, on a day by day, and on a minute by minute basis.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And most importantly of all, harmony reigned in my relationship. It wasn’t like my girlfriend and I never fought. We disagreed vehemently over issues like everyone else. But now our lines of communication were clear. They weren’t burdened with the anxiety and misunderstandings caused by mercury. When she and I disagreed, we went ahead and argued, we resolved it, we got over it and got on with our lives.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Healing is of course, an ongoing process. It took me 32 years to get as sick as I did, and though I’m healthier now than I’ve ever been in my life, I’m not resting on my laurels. The heavy metal mess isn’t quite cleaned up yet.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Though I’ve finished my mercury chelation, I still do ongoing rounds of DMSA to reduce my burden of lead. Most of the lead in my body is stored in my bones, and will only come out slowly over a period of years as I chelate it. Thankfully, DMSA is presenting none of the hardships it did the first time around. I’m prepared this time, keeping firm control over my yeast issues.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Nowadays, besides avoiding sugar and gluten, I can eat whatever I want. I also take a lot fewer supplements than I did when I was on ALA. In the past year, I dropped the ones I no longer need: B12, inositol, digestive enzymes, progesterone cream, kelp, Adrenal Cortex, chromium, glutamine. But because I’m chelating, and still technically heavy metal toxic, I still take the basics: Vitamin C, vitamin E, flax oil, magnesium, milk thistle and ginkgo biloba. I also take probiotics, to help keep me free of yeast symptoms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Yeast and gluten intolerance are my only two symptoms that still linger. I do hope that they will fade away as my body burden of lead decreases. I would like to make it all the way to 100% perfect health some day. But if this never happens, I won’t complain. I’ve been given more than I could ever have dreamed. My life is full of love, friendship, work, cats, creativity, and the thing that makes it all possible: stable, beautiful health.</span></span></span></p>
