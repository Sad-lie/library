Overseen by the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, the evaluations were designed to isolate any neurophysiological or personality features—mental hardware or software—that tended to coincide with good psychic abilities. The range of tests was bizarre; it was almost reminiscent of the testing regimen inflicted on the first astronaut candidates back in the 1960s, when so little had been known about what manned spaceflight would entail. But Puthoff and Targ and the CIA wanted to cast a wide net. If they could isolate any features related to psi ability, however unexpected those features might be, they might learn something about the way psi worked, and how it could be enhanced. In addition, they might be able to use such features as a kind of screening tool for selecting psychics from the general population.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>The evaluations that Pat Price, Ingo Swann, and the others underwent included a complete medical history, eight blood tests, waking EEGs, sleeping EEGs, ear tests, eye tests, a brain magnetic imaging scan, a dynamometer grip strength test, the Groove Pegboard test, the Verbal Concept Attainment test, the Halstead-Wepman Aphasia Screening test, the Bender Gestalt Visual Motor test, the Buschke Memory test, the Benton Visual Memory test, the Knox Cube test, the Tactual Performance test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Edwards Personality Preference Schedule, the Thematic Apperception Test—and the good old Rorschach inkblot test.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Alas, despite all of this neuropsychological poking and probing, there emerged no clear profile of what made a good psychic<a id="filepos360163" href="#filepos384972">*</a> But there were, here and there, hints of distinguishing factors. There was some evidence to suggest, for example, that the most talented psychics in the population would also be relatively intuitive, non-judgmental, emotionally sensitive, and very intelligent. Being more prone to altered states and the visionary experiences that went with them, many would also exhibit some of the characteristics of people with dissociative disorders. Moreover, it seemed that the best psychics would be more likely to exhibit EEG “asynchronicities,” or patterns of abnormally imbalanced electrical activity, between the two halves of the brain. One often found such <a id="filepos360883"></a>EEG asynchronicities in individuals with minor seizure disorders or hyperactivity disorders. One also found them in people who could do certain things extraordinarily well, such as mentally calculating Pi to ten thousand places, or automatically naming the day of the week that, say, November 29, 2042 would fall on, or <a id="filepos361211"></a>playing a Mozart piano concerto flawlessly after hearing it only once.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To at least one scientist, what was most striking about the SRI psychics was that they managed to seem so ordinary, despite their differentness. Some of them had had relatively intense dissociative experiences, had high IQs, and clearly didn’t fit into the world the same way other people did.<a id="filepos361662" href="#filepos385215">*</a> And yet for the most part they were functional, emotionally healthy people—in some cases, much more functional and healthy than the average person. Joseph Campbell, in his studies of primitive religion, had noted that shamans shared some of the qualities of neurotics and schizophrenics, but Campbell had concluded that “<a id="filepos362050"></a>the shamanistic crisis, when properly fostered, yields an adult not only of superior intelligence and refinement, but also of greater physical stamina and vitality of spirit than is normal to the members of the group.” It must have been tempting to think that, like the great shamans of yore, the psychics at SRI walked on that exalted edge between boring ordinariness and the chaos of mental illness.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The relationship between psi and mental illness was never a major focus of research at SRI, and Puthoff and Targ never seriously discussed it in any of their published reports. But they did have occasion to confront it. One of their psi subjects was a patient in the Stanford University Medical Center psychiatric ward.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">He had been admitted to the ward after claiming that his <a></a>wife, and her secret lover, were out to get him. He could hear their voices, could see them plotting from afar … In short, he had classic symptoms of acute paranoid schizophrenia. But his claims about being able to read other people’s thoughts and to see things happening in remote places were so insistent that one of the psychiatrists, knowing about the SRI research, approached Puthoff and asked if he had any interest in the case. Puthoff was skeptical. He suggested that the psychiatrist first do his own informal experiments, putting some playing cards in an envelope and seeing whether the patient could guess them.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The psychiatrist followed Puthoff’s suggestion, and soon reported back that the patient had no trouble identifying cards hidden in envelopes. But that was true only if he was unmedicated. When he was given the antipsychotic drug Thorazine, his psi abilities were suppressed along with his psychoses. Puthoff eventually agreed to take a look at the man, and after running several tests found that he was indeed an extraordinary savant. But Puthoff also found that his subject was very disorganized mentally—in fact, “crazier than a loon”—and was almost impossible to work with. Puthoff sent him back to Stanford. He heard later from the psychiatrist that the man’s voices had been right all along. After an extensive investigation the police had determined that the man’s wife and her lover <em class="calibre4">had</em> been plotting to kill him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Such cases suggested that psychiatric problems, perhaps by encouraging altered states of consciousness, might somehow activate or enable whatever it was in the brain that governed psi abilities. More worrisome was the possibility that the reverse could also be true: that practicing a lot of psi could cause psychiatric problems.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Already there were hints that this might be the case. In June 1973, at the invitation of a Czech researcher named Zdenek Rejdak, Puthoff and Swann had travelled to Prague for something called the First International Conference on <a id="filepos365300"></a>Psychotronic Research. “Psychotronic Research” was the Eastern Europeans’ pseudo-technical term for psi research. In any case, at the conference Puthoff and Swann were virtually mobbed by Soviet and Eastern European psi researchers, who seemed most anxious to know one thing: How did SRI keep its psychic subjects mentally stable? Swann deduced from the questions that some of the Soviet bloc subjects had begun to have serious problems.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">No one at SRI had descended into madness, but for those subjects who had been plucked out of a relatively psi-free life, such as <a id="filepos365968"></a>Duane Elgin, it seemed that the sudden exposure to psi phenomena could have important effects on beliefs and behavior. Elgin had had quite a high-flying career as an SRI futurologist. He was considered creative but levelheaded, was making a substantial amount of money, and was respected by his peers and by the policy makers who read his reports. And then one day, according to the story, a statistician colleague at SRI began flipping a coin; Elgin, asked to guess heads or tails, did so correctly thirty-three times in a row. Puthoff soon heard about this and started running Elgin through some outbound remote-viewing experiments. Elgin also did some PK work, and one day when no one else was in the room, he claimed, he made a pendulum swing wildly, just by concentrating on it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As Elgin’s interest in psi phenomena intensified, it began to change his life. Before long he wrote up a very strange futurological report, and circulated it among his SRI colleagues. In the report, Elgin declared that if psi were not taken more seriously by mainstream science, there might soon be a “civil war” between psychics and non-psychics.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Elgin eventually left SRI, simultaneously taking up with a Tibetan guru who lived in San Francisco. He remained a sane and functional man, and would later become a successful author. But naturally some of his former colleagues at SRI found the sudden change in him disturbing. <em class="calibre4">What has my program done to this poor guy?</em> wondered Puthoff—although <a id="filepos367635"></a>in the end Puthoff reasoned that Elgin had probably always had a mystical streak that his psi experiences had simply brought to the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Elgin himself considered his psi experiences at SRI to have been deeply transformative. He would tell a reporter for <em class="calibre4">New York</em> magazine in 1975: “Once you discover that space doesn’t matter, or that time can be travelled through at will so that time doesn’t matter, and that matter can be moved by consciousness so that matter doesn’t matter—well, you can’t go home again.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">You can’t go home again. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. Yet Elgin’s life-changing experience with psi was a smooth ride compared with what happened to several employees of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Livermore Lab was one of the two institutions—Los Alamos in New Mexico was the other—where most of America’s nuclear weapons research and development took place. It occupied a square mile on the site of an old naval air station, next to the California town of Livermore, a few dozen miles inland from San Francisco Bay. The lab employed several thousand physicists and support personnel, and its security was among the highest of any facility in America.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By 1974 a number of Livermore personnel had heard about the experiments going on at nearby SRI, and, along with everyone else in America, had heard about the feats of Uri Geller. When Geller wasn’t confounding the researchers at SRI, he was criss-crossing the continent, from talk show to stage show, bending spoons and stopping watches, and blowing minds.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It occurred to some of these Livermore personnel that Geller’s feats, if they were genuine, represented a potentially serious security threat. If someone like Geller could really stop watches or interfere with television screens, what could he do to an ICBM’s guidance computer? Or to the <a></a>detonation trigger for a nuclear warhead? No one else seemed interested in looking at psychokinesis phenomena from a security standpoint, so a small group at Livermore decided to check it out themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The group included a security officer named Ron Robertson, a physicist named Peter Crane, and about a half dozen other scientists and engineers. They worked on a variety of experiments with Geller during late 1974 and early 1975. Some were informal, and some were tightly controlled, but everything was done outside work hours, on a volunteer basis.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And since Geller was such a controversial figure, they kept him out of the actual Livermore facility. Instead they worked with him in a borrowed lab on an adjacent low-security facility, which had been carved out of the Livermore campus some years before, for the use of the University of California at Davis. The lab was in an old, wooden, World War II—built barracks structure, and the Livermore researchers brought Geller in on evenings and weekends when no one else was around.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The experiments were generally designed to test Geller’s psychokinetic abilities. For example, he was asked to do his metal-bending feats on a variety of items while being videotaped from the side, from above, and even from underneath. Some objects were specially prepared with a coating of easily crushed “microspheres” which would betray any effort to bend the coated object by direct mechanical force. The group was relieved to find, just as Puthoff and Targ had found, that Geller apparently couldn’t bend metal when he was prevented from actually touching it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In other more delicate psychokinesis experiments, the group set up high-quality lasers and fired them at sensitive detector arrays to see if Geller could remotely deflect the beams. He couldn’t. And when Geller was given a computer’s magnetic program card, and was asked to erase it, he was unable to do so when the card was sealed inside a <a></a>bottle. He was able to do it only when allowed to rub the card with his fingers. It seemed to the Livermore group that if Geller did have some kind of psychokinetic ability, it wasn’t one that could work over long distances. America’s nuclear weapons were probably safe.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On the other hand, Geller occasionally did do something outside the laboratory that was genuinely spooky. One day Ron Robertson was on the phone with him for some reason, and Geller suddenly stopped in mid-conversation. His voice changed slightly, and he said, “Ron, I see you involved with somebody with a large white dog. I see you very concerned over the health of an older man. I see trouble between two women close to you.” Whereupon he resumed the conversation in a normal voice.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Four or five days later, on a Saturday morning, Robertson and his wife suddenly decided to go down to Pacific Grove, near Monterey, to visit an old friend. On arrival they discovered that their friend had recently acquired an enormous white German shepherd. A few minutes later Robertson’s friend mentioned that an old acquaintance, a theater director for whom Robertson had worked back in the days when he was a stage lighting operator, was seriously ill and about to die. As Robertson sat there in his friend’s house, wondering how the third prediction would come to pass, his wife somehow got into a disagreement with their host’s daughter; the two women ended up in a virtual shouting match.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">One day in the lab, several members of the Livermore group were monitoring Geller during a metal-bending session. They recorded him with audiotape, filmed him with videotape, and photographed him with a variety of still cameras, including one that was sensitive to thermal infrared radiation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After the experiment they developed all the film and saw something very strange. The infrared camera had captured <a></a>what seemed to be two diffuse patches of radiation on the upper part of one of the laboratory walls. It was as if someone had briefly shone two large heat sources, either from inside the lab or outside pointing in. The patches grew in intensity for a few frames, then over the next few frames diminished to nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Livermore Group were understandably puzzled over this, but it was only the beginning of the strangeness that would soon consume them. When they checked the audiotape they had made during the experiment, they found amid everything else a distinctive, metallic-sounding voice, unheard during the actual experiment but now clearly audible, if mostly unintelligible. All they could make out were a few apparently random words strung together.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">If Geller could be believed, things like this had happened before. According to one story, on several occasions when his friend Andrija Puharich had put him under hypnosis,<a id="filepos375529" href="#filepos385873">*</a> audiotapes of the sessions had recorded similar strange voices. Another time, at a meeting with some Mossad officers, someone’s tape recorder had suddenly seemed to start playing by itself, in full view of everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In any case, Peter Crane and some of the others in the Livermore group quickly found themselves involved in more strangeness than they could handle. In the days and weeks that followed, they began to feel that they were collectively possessed by some kind of tormenting, teasing, hallucination-inducing spirit. They all would be in a laboratory together, setting up some experiment, or one of the fellows and his wife and children would be at home, just sitting around, when suddenly there in the middle of the room would be a weird, hovering, almost comically stereotypical image of a flying saucer. It was always about eight inches across, in a gray, fuzzy monochrome, as if it were <a></a>some kind of hologram. The thematic connection with Geller was obvious, when one remembered that Geller claimed to be controlled by a giant computerized flying saucer named Spectra.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On the other hand, the flying saucer wasn’t the only form the Livermore visions took. There were sometimes animals—fantastic animals from the ecstatic lore of shamans—such as the large raven-like birds that were seen traipsing through the yards of several members of the group. One of them appeared briefly to a physicist named Mike Russo and his terrified wife. The two were lying around one morning when suddenly there was this giant bird staring at them from the foot of their bed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After a few weeks of this, Russo and some of the others began seriously to wonder if they were losing their sanity. Peter Crane decided to call for help. He picked up the phone and called Richard Kennett.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett had visited Livermore previously, in his capacity as a CIA analyst, to ask Crane and the others about their results with Geller. He had remained close-mouthed about the CIA’s own psi research, but that had been expected. As far as Crane was concerned, Kennett was their best hope for a private, quiet solution to the problem. He had parapsychological experience, biomedical training, and high-level security access—an extremely rare set of qualifications.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On a Saturday morning not long thereafter, at the end of an otherwise unrelated trip to the San Francisco Bay Area, Kennett drove over and met with Crane in a coffee shop in the town of Livermore. Crane set out the situation for him, and soon Kennett was having long meetings with Russo and the others. They perspired, trembled, and even wept openly as they related some of the things that had happened to them. It was as if their world had collapsed around them. Nothing made sense anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett knew that if he took any of these stories to a regular psychiatrist, the diagnosis would be some kind of <a></a>dissociative, hallucinatory, or otherwise delusional experience. Even when two or three people claimed to have shared a vision, it would almost certainly be dismissed as <em class="calibre4">folie à deux</em>, or <em class="calibre4">folie à trois</em>. Such terms were used to refer to rare group hallucinations, when one hallucinating or delusional individual had such a dominant personality that others came to believe they had seen or experienced the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett didn’t rule out such explanations, but he seemed fairly convinced that something else less pat and conventional was going on. For one thing, Crane, Russo, and the others had no history of involvement in the occult, and as far as Kennett could tell, their emotional situations immediately prior to these visionary experiences hadn’t been particularly stressful or otherwise hallucinogenic. Moreover, they all had top-secret security clearances, which had required among other things that they be screened for psychological disorders.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Then there was the very strange business of the metallic voice on the audiotape. Among the few intelligible words it pronounced were two or three together which Kennett recognized as the code name of a very closely held government project. The project had nothing to do with psychic research, and neither it nor its code name was known to Crane or Russo or the others at Livermore. It was as if whoever or whatever had produced the code name on the tape had known that Kennett would soon arrive on the scene and had saved this special shiver down the spine just for him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett, going by the book, reported the code name incident to the security people at the CIA, muting the outlandish details only slightly. The security people filed it away, and wondered if Dr. Kennett might be getting a little too close to his subject matter.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a></a>The situation at Livermore eventually resolved itself, after Russo complained about a telephone call from the strange metallic voice. The voice demanded that the Livermore group cease its research activities with Geller. The group did, and within a month, the bizarre apparitions faded away.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of the last such apparitions sprang itself upon a Livermore physicist named Don Curtis and his wife. They were sitting in their living room one evening, soberly, uneventfully, not talking about Geller or the paranormal, when suddenly there was this … arm … hovering holographically in the middle of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The arm was clothed as if it belonged to a man wearing a plain gray suit. There was no bloody stump where it should have connected with a shoulder. It merely faded into clear space. But at the end of the arm where a hand should have been, there was no hand, only a hook. The hooked arm twisted around for a few seconds in front of Curtis and his wife, and then disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Curtis related the story to Kennett, and for some reason, it seemed to push the CIA officer over the edge. He telephoned Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ and demanded that they meet with him on their next trip to Washington. He didn’t quite believe that they could have cooked all of this up, using their SRI lasers to make haunted-house holograms. But he suspected that with their own ample experiences of Geller and his associated phenomena, they would be able to shed some light on what was happening.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Within a few days, Puthoff and Targ arrived in Washington for a scheduled fund-raising tour of government offices. Kennett met them shortly after they had arrived at their hotel, and though it was close to midnight, he sat them down and told them the whole story, including the story of the floating arm.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“And so the goddamn arm—” said Kennett, winding up his story. “The thing was rotating, with this gray suit on, <a></a>and it had a hook on it. It was a false arm. What do you think of that?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And as Kennett pronounced the word <em class="calibre4">that</em>, there was a sharp, heavy pounding on the door to the hotel room, as if someone were intending to knock it down. Kennett had a mischievous streak. Was he playing some kind of practical joke here? Puthoff and Targ didn’t think so. The pounding was so loud, it was frightening. After a moment, Targ went over to the window and hid behind the curtains. Puthoff stood inside the bathroom. Kennett went over to the door and opened it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Standing in the doorway was a man who at first glance was remarkable only by his unremarkableness. He was nondescript and unthreatening, somewhere in middle age. He walked past Kennett very slowly, with a stiff gait, to the middle of the room, between the two beds. He turned around, and said in an oddly stilted voice, <em class="calibre4">“Oh! I guess … I must … be … in … the wrong … room.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre_14">And with that he walked out, slowly, stiffly, giving all of them time to see that one sleeve of his gray suit, pinned to his side, was empty.</p>
