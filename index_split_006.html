<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span class="bold"><span><span class="calibre2">FLASHES OF FANTASTIC</span></span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As spring turned to summer, after 22 rounds of DMSA, my dump phase wound down, right on schedule. I felt some relief, my mercury symptoms were definitely less pronounced. It was good, I certainly wasn’t complaining, but all that time I’d spent gazing at the graph of the dump phase, I’d hoped that my improvement would be more dramatic by the time I got to the bottom of the curve.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Physically, I could see improvements. I was now able to hold it together most of the time if I ate very carefully, took my supplements religiously, chelated like clockwork every other weekend, and avoided doing anything too taxing. My brain situation was improving too. My mood wasn’t quite so steeped in darkness, and I was very occasionally able to attempt a little writing. I wasn’t turning out anything good, of course. The part of my brain that was in charge of creativity had gone awol many months ago. And in general, I wasn’t as smart as I used to be. I was slower, duller, much less fun to be around. But at least I was alive, I didn’t feel like I was going to be destroyed at any moment.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The five-day course of Diflucan had been intense, but it had done its job. Around day four, I’d turned very pale with a hint of yellow and my liver had ached, but by the end of it, the yeast had been cleared from everywhere. My skin was completely free of the tinea versicolor fungal rash for the first time in ages. But the adrenal formula I got from the doctor didn’t turn out so great.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was obvious that my adrenals were in distress. I had several classic symptoms: excessive exhaustion after exercise, intolerance of foods high in potassium, salt cravings, inconsistent energy levels, and the ‘adrenal silhouette’: my curves had melted away and I was all bones and corners. I’d hoped that this adrenal formula would be different, but it was like every other adrenal remedy I’d ever tried. It boosted my energy some, but no matter how early in the day I took it, I ended up suffering from insomnia, too wired to relax and fall asleep. I gave up on it after a few days.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But I was happy with the rest of the help that the doctor was giving me. When I went back for my second appointment to hear the results of my blood work, I learned that I had low magnesium, low vitamin D, low B12, and low iron.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I can mix you up a cocktail,” he said. “Give them all to you at once, intravenously. It can take so long to get your levels up if you take them orally.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Um, no way,” I said. “What if I had a bad reaction to one of them? How would I know which one it was? At a really high dose? It sounds like a bad idea.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re right,” he said. “Forgive me, I’m a doctor. I can’t help coming up with ideas like that.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s okay,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But what would you say to a tiny injection of B12?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sure,” I said. “Why not?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The B12 was literally a shot in the arm. I could feel it strengthening me. It was the beginning of the summer now, and I was able to occasionally take out my bicycle and ride for a few miles on the flat bicycle trail that ran by our house.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was all a definite improvement. I was in another place now. I had graduated from being a very sick young person to being a moderately healthy 80-year-old. If I was ready to accept that my brain had degenerated, that my work days were over, that I had to take exquisite care of every aspect of my mind and body for the rest of my life, then I could expect to lead a quietly contented life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was 33 years old. I wasn’t ready to roll over and say die just yet.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There were detox options that I hadn’t even begun to explore. The only chelator I’d taken so far was DMSA. It was designed to speed mercury clearance from the bloodstream and alleviate symptoms. But Alpha Lipoic Acid, or ALA, was a whole other kind of animal. It was a chelator that had the special ability to cross cell membranes and penetrate the blood-brain barrier. It could root out mercury that otherwise would be trapped inside my brain, impairing my function forever.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">ALA wasn’t a touchy-feely detox option. It wasn’t meant to make people feel good. It was a serious chelator with a serious job to do. A lot of the people on the Frequent Dose Chelation board reported a sharp increase in side effects when they started taking ALA. So to make ALA chelation go easier, it was recommended to take DMSA along with it, to keep the mercury symptom profile down.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I decided to start taking ALA. There was no reason not to. At this point, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. If it all went well, I would get my brain function back. Mercury would be cleared out of my endocrine glands too, which were particularly sticky to mercury. My adrenals would return to life. I would be my old self again, strong and sane and healthy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But there was no guarantee that I would be able to tolerate ALA chelation. The dose that delivered results was 100mg, every three hours around the clock. Some people on the boards were struggling hard, trying and failing to get accustomed to doses as low as 5 or 6mg. Some of these people did perfectly fine with DMSA, but ALA floored them with overwhelming side effects.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I set out to find out exactly how much ALA I could take.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And so it was back to splitting up capsules. But since ALA was a lot cheaper than DMSA, I just dumped most of the contents of the capsules down the sink and carefully eyeballed what was left to make sure that the doses were reasonably consistent. I couldn’t measure them exactly, but the first round I took involved doses that couldn’t have been more than 5mg each. I added a capsule to each of my regular doses of DMSA, and reduced my dosing frequency to every 3 hours.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Minutes after taking my first dose, I felt terrible. I was spaced out, but not in the pleasant way I’d been coming off my first round of DMSA. I felt zoned out, stupid and confused. I also had a tense feeling in the nape of my neck, kind of like a headache that didn’t actually hurt. These feelings lasted for the whole round, and I also developed a stomachache and diarrhea. It was quite miserable.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I knew that people had different reactions to different brands of ALA, so over the next few rounds, I experimented with different doses and brands. I tried ALA from Vitamin Research Products, the company who produced the DMSA I used. The stomach upset and diarrhea instantly disappeared. But the VRP capsules were so small and fiddly, it was extremely difficult to eyeball a consistent dose of 5mg.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And it probably wasn’t a good idea to attempt to make up my doses while on round. In the middle of my zoned-out dopiness on my second round of ALA, I came up with the bright idea of pouring the powder into larger, empty capsules so that I could judge the volume of the powder better.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I bungled it up terribly, but didn’t realize it until I’d already taken most of the doses I’d made up. The capsules I’d thought had 5mg in them turned out to contain something more like 75mg. Ouch. But the odd thing was, I didn’t feel any more confused or stoned than I did on 5mg. I finished out the round at 75mg, doing the bare minimum permitted on the protocol, three days and two nights, rather than three full 24-hour ‘days.’ I finished up by taking DMSA alone for a few doses, something that was recommended to minimize the symptoms of redistribution. And in the end, nothing dramatic happened. I felt better when the round ended and the dopiness wore off, and then I felt worse for a couple of days when redistribution hit. But it didn’t hit any harder at 75mg than it had at 5mg.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I decided to dispense with the ridiculously fussy process of splitting capsules. I liked the ALA made by VRP, but the smallest denomination it came in was 100mg. So from then on, I took 100mg of ALA every three hours around the clock with my customary 25mg of DMSA. I did this every other weekend without fail, never skipping a round, never having to end a round early because of a missed dose. I had done some retail research online and now was the proud owner of a stylish-looking chunky pink watch that you could program with eight separate vibrating alarms. I also had found a slim little travel clock that had an alarm that was ridiculously easy to reset. You could do it in your sleep, which was exactly what I needed to do.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had my chelation routine down pat. I started at the same time every other week. Friday mornings, I took an empty clear pill minder and filled the first four compartments with my daytime chelation doses. M was the noon dose, T was the 3pm dose, W was the 6pm dose, Th was the 9pm dose. I donned my vibrating watch, and activated the alarms. Then I set the travel alarm for five minutes past noon. This alarm was the backup. If I failed to heed my vibrating alarm, this one would give me a second reminder to take my dose. This was especially important at night, when I sometimes slept through the vibrating alarm. And the clear pill holder was crucial to keep things straight at night too. In my sleepy dopey ALA state, I often woke up and asked myself questions like, <span class="italic">It’s 3:02am, did I just take my dose? The backup alarm hasn’t gone off yet, did I take the dose or not?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">A flick of the flashlight and a quick glance at the 3am compartment of the pill minder was all that was needed. If the capsules were in there, I hadn’t taken them yet, if they were, I could go back to sleep, confident that I hadn’t missed a dose, or accidentally taken it twice.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The mechanics of the rounds of chelation were pretty simple, but being on round with ALA was quite hard. I’d hoped that the dopey feeling would fade as the rounds went by. I’d had side effects on DMSA at first that had faded by the time three or four rounds had gone by. But ALA’s effect on me was a stubborn presence that wouldn’t go away. It faded a little bit, especially towards the end of rounds. Sunday evenings were often okay, but I never really felt good or comfortable when ALA was in my system.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was pretty sure that the effect ALA had on my brain wasn’t about the movement of mercury in my body. It was more to do with the chemical nature of ALA itself. Often, mercury toxic people had problems regulating a certain class of biochemicals in their system called ‘thiols.’ ALA was known to raise the body’s thiol levels, as did many other ordinary substances like garlic and broccoli and milk. I’d never noticed having this kind of reaction to broccoli or milk, but the garlic capsules the dentist had given me had wrecked my head. It looked like I was slightly on the high-thiol end of the spectrum, and the concentrated thiol-raising power of garlic or ALA capsules was enough to push me over the edge.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">ALA was raising my thiols, but it was also definitely moving mercury around my system. Every round seemed to knock a little bit of the stuffing out of me. I was left increasingly worn out, and the gains I got from taking vitamin C and getting B12 shots were more than wiped out. I got up and did things when I had to, I made a special effort to be up and about on the weekends when my girlfriend was home, but whenever I could, I conserved energy by resting in bed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It certainly was a blessing that the dump phase was over, I didn’t have to fight so hard to repress the voice of the mercury monster whispering in my head. But as ALA gradually scooped me hollow, I found that I didn’t really have much going on inside me at all. I didn’t have the energy and spark to think things up. My trains of thought didn’t really go anywhere. They ran in circles, or just quietly ran out of steam. I didn’t even have the oomph to find fault with my girlfriend and pick fights. Our relationship was peaceful, but it was a sad kind of peace. I got the feeling that I had been turned into a ghost, haunting my own life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The hours and hours I spent in bed were hard to fill. Time crawled by, especially since my entertainment options were limited. I’d stopped enjoying listening to music, so that was out. When I listened now, even my favorite songs sounded empty. I couldn’t define what was different, they all seemed to sound the same, but I found them to be more of an annoyance than entertainment.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Reading also had its difficulties. There were times when I propped a book up in front of my eyes, scanned the words, went through all the correct motions, but it just didn’t take. It would feel incredibly tedious and exhausting to attempt to follow where the writer was going with all this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My difficulties reminded me of a discussion I’d read in a writing book once, where the author had marveled at what we writers demand of our readers. We ask them to stare for hours at strings of tiny black marks on a page we have composed. And with only these very little prompts, we direct them to daydream up the rooms and people and telling glances and heartrending moments that we writers see in our heads. My brain often wasn’t up for this momentous task. As a devoted and voracious reader, this was a particular hardship.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And still I chelated, staying steady on my course. No one said this was going to be easy. And no one said it was going to be quick. It seemed that two years was a good estimate of how long ALA chelation would take. I combed the boards for some idea of how it would go. Would I be hollowed-out and worn down for a year and eleven months, then I’d spring back all at once to my true shape? Or would it be a gradual filling-out, where the progress every day was slow, but I made it there in the end, inch by inch?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The truth seemed to lie somewhere between these two. People on the boards talked about long periods with no gains, and then after a year, hitting a turning point at 50 or 60 rounds of ALA. From my perspective of having completed 6 rounds of ALA, at the snail’s pace of a round every other weekend, 50 or 60 rounds may as well have been as far away as the moon.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">So I adapted to my new life. This was what I did now, I chelated. And did my best to fill the rest of my time. I bought the complete 85-episode run of the TV show thirtysomething on DVD and watched them all one by one on my laptop in bed. I’d watched this show back in Ireland as a teenager, around the time that I got my amalgams out. I’d loved it, but of course the lives of couples in their thirties living in America were very foreign to me. Now that I was a thirtysomething living in New York State, it should have reflected my experience, but I was no longer engaged in that life. Their struggles to build a career felt like something from my distant past. When the character Michael decided to be a writer, I laughed ruefully at what he went through. I had done that once. I had struggled to learn to write, but that had happened to another me. It was all gone now, swept away by the mercury. There was no way to tell if it would ever return.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Soon it was fall again, and my 34th birthday rolled around. I found myself looking back and taking stock as I often did at this time of year. It had been two years since I’d had my amalgams out, a year since I’d figured out I was mercury toxic and begun chelating. I had completed 30 rounds of DMSA in total, and nine of these rounds had included ALA. I was on my tenth round of ALA on my birthday. It felt more intense than recent rounds. I was more tired, unable to walk for any distance without needing to sit down, but at the same time I felt more peaceful and hopeful. Maybe it was the birthday nostalgia talking, but I felt like I was turning a corner, like something was going to change.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was sitting on the bus going to work 36 hours after my birthday round ended. I was all prepared to feel like crap. Redistribution was due to hit, and I was ready to take whatever it dished out. But the fact of the matter was that I was feeling strong and energetic. I was sitting up straight in my seat, relishing the thought of spending the day engaged in physical labor.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The bus driver had the radio on, and was clicking through the stations, looking for a good song.  He landed on one that caught my attention. It was utterly arresting. I was riveted by the music, it made me want to laugh out loud in delight. What was this exquisite masterpiece?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The chords seemed to progress perfectly inside my mind, making my emotions resonate with happiness. What was this song? Was it new? Was it old? Why had I never heard it before?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Halfway through the song, the bus driver clicked over to another station. I stared at him with my mouth hanging open. Was he crazy? I looked around, but the other passengers weren’t raising an outcry.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was then that I realized that the song wasn’t special. It was just another piece of Lite FM fluff. Any specialness that was going on was happening inside me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In the following days, it became clear that the round had shifted something inside my brain. Music sounded great again. And weirdly, some notes sounded a lot greater than others. That song I heard that morning featured a lot of bass notes that seemed to resonate with me. I couldn’t find anyone else talking about this on the forums, but in the following months, some frequencies—even if they were generated by the rumble of a truck engine—sounded extra beautiful to me. And best of all, my ability to enjoy music was back. Permanently.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The return of music felt like a birthday gift. It was just the start of it. Every two weeks, I got another gift when I completed a round of ALA. My vision improved. Things had looked fine before, but suddenly, they were more crisp, like I’d traded in regular vision for HDTV. Then my hearing improved. My problem-solving skills returned. Everyday situations that used to baffle me were now easy to figure out. My night vision improved, and I became a better driver.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The best gift of all was when I got up one morning after a round, and sat on the porch watching the sunrise. I was able to appreciate the beauty with my crystal-clear vision. But it was nothing compared to the awesome miracle I suddenly experienced. I heard a witty remark inside my head. What a jolt. Then there was another one. Whoa! Next I thought up a funny little song. Oh my God! This hadn’t happened in so long, but I remembered it now—I was a funny person!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In the following months it waxed and waned with the rhythms of chelation, but for hours, sometimes days at a time, the inside of my head became a fun place to be.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I continued to chelate, but after a few months the delightful surprises petered out. I knew now for a fact that ALA chelation absolutely and definitely worked, but what did it mean that I had made such progress after taking it for so few rounds? Was I well now? Was it over? Was the mercury gone?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Honestly, it didn’t feel gone. Yes, the gifts I had been given were wonderful. I felt like I was being visited by parts of myself that I’d given up as dead. It was a profoundly beautiful experience to have a day where I sounded like my old self inside my head. But that was the problem. It was just a day or so here and there. Then the mercury clouds would gather, or I’d get on round again, and it was back to bed to watch thirtysomething.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t begrudge them, my flashes of fantastic. I didn’t want them to go away. But in a way, they made life harder to manage. I was up, I was down. I was a yo-yo at the end of a string, like I’d been during the dump phase. Some days I felt so well, so vibrant in my mind, that I wondered why I wasn’t looking for a job, making something of myself. Others, it was all I could do to heat up a frozen dinner and eat it in bed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Still, my flashes of energy had to go somewhere. I decided that writing would be a good job to take on in my condition. I wouldn’t have to get up and suit up and drive to the office every day. I could take things at my own pace, writing when I could, and putting it on hold on days when things were difficult. Things had gone so well for me on ALA, I wanted to spread the word about Frequent Dose Chelation. I decided I would explore the possibility of writing about it, and even talked to Andy Cutler, the author of <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span> about my ideas.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My energy got channeled into my relationship too. I began to talk to my girlfriend again. The silence was broken and I began to chatter to her about whatever was on my mind.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One night we were lying in bed falling asleep, and I noticed for the umpteenth time that the guys at the train station across the street had left the barrier down long after the train had left the station. The bells just kept on ringing minute after minute.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Doesn’t it bother you?” I asked my girlfriend. “The endless ringing?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She lifted her head from the pillow. “I don’t hear anything.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“At the barrier,” I said. “Across the—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It suddenly dawned on me that the ringing I was hearing wasn’t loud enough to be the barrier.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh my God,” I laughed. “It’s not real. All this time I thought it was across the street, but it was just ringing in my ears. I guess it gets quiet at night, so that’s when I notice it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Doesn’t that have a name?” my girlfriend asked. “Tintinitus?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Just one ‘tin,’” I corrected. “Tinnitus. I think Tintin is a dog.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, that’s Rin Tin Tin,” my girlfriend said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The conversation paused, and I closed my eyes, listening to bells that weren’t really there.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s a terrible affliction,” my girlfriend said. “Rintintinitus.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes it is,” I agreed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Constantly hearing dogs barking,” she continued. “When they’re not really there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The two of us collapsed into giggles. A frozen place in my heart thawed out. How long had it been since we had made each other laugh?</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend and I were speaking more, but I didn’t really have a lot of material. Lots of my stories revolved around things people had said on the mercury forums, or clever ways I’d learned to control mercury symptoms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One day we were driving somewhere, and she said she was going to make a quick stop at the gas station to buy an ice-cream bar.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You should take chromium,” I said. “It would even out your blood sugar and you wouldn’t get sugar cravings.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She turned to me, anger written across her face and I was very surprised. I’d recently offered her lots of tidbits of advice like this, and she’d seemed happy to hear them.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I am a human being!” she said. “I am not a jar of chemicals where you add a bit of this and a bit of that and make a perfect machine. I like ice cream! Normal people eat ice cream sometimes! And I get to decide when to eat it!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sorry,” I said. “I didn’t realize I was being rude.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I analyzed this exchange. My girlfriend was a very tolerant person, so for her to turn on my like this must mean that I was being totally obnoxious without realizing it. Just because I felt better than I had before didn’t mean that my ability to communicate like a normal person was restored.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I’d had months of practice at curbing the mercury monster’s tongue. But now I saw that it wasn’t just about keeping my mouth shut when I felt abysmal. All that mercury moving around my brain must have screwed up my social skills. It was now possible for me to start fights even when I was in a good mood. I resolved to redouble my efforts to monitor the appropriateness of what I planned to say. It would be horrible to mess up my relationship now, after everything we’d been through.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t say it to my girlfriend, but I knew that what she’d said was wrong. Human beings were jars of chemicals that could be fixed. And if I kept pouring ALA into my jar at regular intervals, hopefully the stuttering engine of my brain would kick into life and start running smoothly sometime soon.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was amazing the puzzles that became easy to solve during my flashes of fantastic. Back when I’d first started chelating, I’d tried to order a hair test. This was the best diagnostic tool to use for heavy metals because it gave more of an idea what was trapped inside cells rather than floating free in the bloodstream. I’d been told I wasn’t allowed to order a hair test because New York State law forbade sending certain medical samples in the mail, and hair was one of them.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Back then, I’d given up on ever having my hair tested, but now I saw an obvious workaround. I asked a friend who lived over the border in Connecticut to order the hair test for me, and a few weeks later, I was sitting at my desk, printing out the full color heavy metal analysis of my hair.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The results were presented as a bar chart, and I first sought out mercury. It was very low, barely registering as a little bump on the graph. This didn’t mean that all my mercury was gone. Mercury readings on hair tests didn’t really have any bearing on a person’s body burden. You could be thoroughly poisoned, your brain stuffed with trapped mercury, with none of it turning up in your hair. The true measure of mercury poisoning was whether the hair test met the counting rules showing deranged mineral transport.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I opened up Cutler’s book <span class="italic">Hair Test Interpretation</span> to find the instructions for the counting rules, but before I began, my eye was drawn to another bar on the graph. It was the toxic element lead. My lead reading wasn’t super-high, but it was there, and it was many times higher than my mercury reading. A conversation from the past echoed through my mind. My holistic dentist telling me I had mercury, yes, but many many times more lead.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I hadn’t thought about lead in ages, not since I’d run through my apartment in the city, swabbing all the surfaces to see where I could be absorbing it from. I flipped through <span class="italic">Hair Test Interpretation</span> and read all the little sections that talked about lead.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was an eye-opener. I finally understood how my system could be full of lead even though there were no sources of lead contamination in my home or environment. When large amounts of lead entered the body, only a fraction of it circulated in the bloodstream. The majority of it was stored in the bones. If a person showed high lead as an adult, there was no way of knowing for sure when they actually absorbed that lead. They could have picked it up at any point in their lives. Only by using detective work could they make a guess by identifying a time in their lives when they began to display lead symptoms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My scalp began to tingle. I got the feeling that I was about to put together something big. There was always something that didn’t sit right for me in my mercury history. My mercury exposure began in my teens when I got my amalgams placed. And yet, when I looked back over my childhood, I saw numerous little clues that pointed to mercury. How could that be? At first, I assumed that my mother had a mouthful of amalgam and passed the mercury on to me in the womb, but when I quizzed my sister about it, she reminded me that my mother hadn’t had any fillings. When enough of her teeth had gone bad, she’d just had them all pulled and got dentures. The mercury content of any vaccines I got didn’t explain things either. When I’d gotten my US visa, I’d had to produce my immunization record, and it was very patchy. In most cases, I’d had the disease rather than the vaccine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My childhood ‘mercury symptoms’ couldn’t have been caused by mercury. But could they have been caused by lead? What were the symptoms of lead poisoning? I looked them over and got goose bumps. Amblyopia or ‘lazy eye’ was mentioned about four times. I’d been prescribed glasses at the age of two in an attempt to correct my lazy eye. One of my earliest memories was being scolded for losing a new pair of glasses the very day I got them.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My other pre-amalgam ‘mercury symptoms’ all fit the lead profile. The chronic constipation I’d had all my life. The ‘delicate stomach’ I’d had. I couldn’t count the number of times I’d been taken to the doctor because of unexplained stomach pains and vomiting. And why had I had Mee’s Lines, white spots on my fingernails that were a sign of heavy metal toxicity all throughout childhood? Not because of mercury, I saw now, but because of lead.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I thought about my younger sister who had a lazy eye too. I thought about the fact that at the age of 5 she’d developed epilepsy, a brain disorder of unknown origin. Could it have been lead? Had our whole family been poisoned? I though about my father’s epilepsy, my mother’s diabetes, the atmosphere of unhappiness and dysfunction I’d grown up in. Could it all have been caused by lead? The family farm I grew up on certainly wasn’t organic. Had anyone ever tested our water supply? Could it have been contaminated?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I let these questions hang. How could I ever be sure of where the lead had come from? All I knew for certain was that I was lead poisoned, and chelating with DMSA was taking the lead out as well as the mercury.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I turned back to my hair test. What would it tell me about mercury? Did my streak of amazing rounds so soon in ALA chelation mean that it was gone, that I wasn’t as sick as I’d thought?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went through the counting rules, and immediately, I met the first rule. Four of my essential elements were in the red zone. This meant that I had deranged mineral transport, I definitely had mercury toxicity, and would still have to chelate extensively with ALA to have any chance of making a full recovery.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was validating to have a piece of paper in my hand that confirmed my diagnosis of mercury toxicity. But it was also sobering news. This thing was real, and I wasn’t out the woods yet, not by a long shot. Mercury toxicity was a ‘fringe’ diagnosis, and hard to explain. I’d often heard myself or my girlfriend glossing over what was wrong with me, saying I ‘just wasn’t feeling well’ or had ‘food allergies’ instead of launching into a long explanation why I couldn’t come to an event or wasn’t eating something. This habit had undermined the reality of my mercury diagnosis. I always believed it inside myself, I knew that my girlfriend always believed it, and people on the internet did too, but somehow it wasn’t real outside of our home.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This hair test was independent confirmation that everything I was going through was real. It made me take myself more seriously. Instead of suffering through my mercury symptoms, I became more proactive in finding ways to support my health.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My hair test yielded a wealth of diagnostic facts, the biggest one being that my thyroid was doing okay, but my adrenals were struggling. This was not surprising news, but hearing it from my hair test galvanized me into action. I was sick, I was going to be chelating for the foreseeable future. My body needed support to get me through this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went on the Frequent Dose Chelation Group and started reading posts about the adrenals. I’d always skipped these posts before because in my mind, there were only two treatment options for adrenal fatigue. On the one hand there were herbal formulae like the one my doctor had given me. I had tried these in so many forms over the years, and all of them made me wired and gave me insomnia. On the other hand, there was direct hormonal replacement of cortisol using prednisone or hydrocortisone. This was necessary for people whose adrenals were unable to perform. Cortisol was the hormone that gave people energy and the ability to withstand stress. I knew I was low. I knew I would benefit if I supplemented with it. But I hated the idea of the inevitable side effects. If I took supplementary adrenal hormone, my body’s natural production of it would shut down. I would effectively be shutting off my adrenals for the duration of supplementation, with no guarantee that ending it would jumpstart them again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t want to do it, but I knew that all the other adrenal remedies didn’t work. Was there no other option?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Reading through the adrenal posts online, I saw that there was something I had missed. There was a product called Adrenal Cortex, which was purely an adrenal glandular extract. It didn’t provide any supplementary adrenal hormones, it didn’t mess around with cortisol production, it just provided the building blocks for damaged adrenals to heal themselves. Dosing didn’t need to be precise, side effects were rare, and a good guideline for tracking adrenal health was to keep a daily temperature chart. When body temperatures stabilized, and didn’t fluctuate day by day, it showed that the adrenals were back on track.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I enjoyed taking my daily temperatures and seeing what they did. Just as the hair test had said, my thyroid was fine. My average temperature hovered around 98.6. If it had been lower, it would have indicated thyroid distress. But even though my average temperature was healthy, the daily and hourly fluctuations were alarming. In the morning I’d be 97.2, but late that afternoon, I’d have shot up to 98.8. There was no pattern to it, a line running through my graph was full of sharp peaks and valleys. But after a slow introduction of Adrenal Cortex, which caused no side effects except a mild case of mysterious itchiness for the first week, my temperatures started to converge. My graph got a lot smoother. I was also happy to note that it also showed the bump in temperature in the middle of my menstrual cycle that showed ovulation had occurred. In spite of all of the stress my body was going through, my ovaries were still functioning.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It wasn’t just the temperature graph that showed improvement. My body let me know that Adrenal Cortex was really working. Used to spending a lot of my spare time in bed, it was a surprise to find that I no longer wanted to linger in bed in the mornings. I wanted to be up and about, getting on with the business of the day. The 3pm dip in my energy, which would often send me to my bed for a nap was now a thing of the past. And best of all, Adrenal Cortex didn’t make me feel wired. When I lay down in bed at night to sleep, I slept, more soundly and deeply than I had in a while.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Adrenal Cortex was great, one of the most important discoveries I’d made on my chelation journey, but it didn’t magically fix everything. I was still suffering through the dopey side effects on ALA, still feeling like a yo-yo at the end of a string as the rounds came and went. I almost could feel the mercury getting mobilized during rounds, and then getting shunted to another part of my body with redistribution. It was like a big game of musical chairs. One round would leave me feeling like my thyroid was suddenly burdened, then the next, it would be clear, but my thoughts patterns would feel more obsessive.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I hated that I could only chelate every other week, and that my rounds were bare-minimum short, but even after a second round of Diflucan, the yeast was just barely under control. I couldn’t risk chelating more with DMSA, and I didn’t want to play around with skipping it and trying ALA without it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was frustrated with how slowly things were going, especially when I looked out into the future and made projections of how long my recovery would take. I needed to complete 50 or 60 rounds of ALA. It was where people on the boards reported having their big turning points. For the average person, that represented a year of chelation. It really was the minimum that anybody could consider a complete course.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But at the rate I was going, chelating every other weekend, I was just completing 26 rounds a year instead of 52. To get to a grand total of 60 rounds of ALA and declare myself done, I would have to chelate for two more years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This was hard to stomach. It was almost Christmas now, I had already chelated for a year, completing 35 rounds in total, but only 14 had included ALA. My chelation journey had gotten off to a late start, delayed for a year after my amalgams got removed because I hadn’t even known I was mercury toxic. All in all, I was asking myself to live through a total of four years of sickness and instability, with unpredictable hours and days of horror and distress. Four years of not having a stable sense of self.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was on round the next time I went into the city to see my therapist. I was lost in the ALA cloud, and telling her how hard it was on my relationship with my girlfriend.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know when I open my mouth,” I said. “Who’s going to come out. Dr. Jekyll or Mercury Hyde.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Maybe you could be more gentle in the way you speak about yourself,” she said. “You’re sick, you don’t feel good. Does that make you a monster?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “You’re right. It’s not that interesting or dramatic. It’s boring. It’s just another tedious case of mental…” I groped through the ALA fog for a word that conveyed the meaning ‘illness’ but wasn’t that word. Finally I gave up and just said it. “…illness.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My therapist just sat there and looked at me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What?” I said. “So I said it. Mental illness. I have a mental illness. So what?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You sound angry right now,” she said. “Do you feel angry?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t say anything. I just glared at her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What are you feeling?” she prompted.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I looked at my watch, there was still 15 minutes left in the session.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I feel like leaving,” I said, gathering up my things. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I stood up to go.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Perhaps we could—” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Perhaps nothing,” I said. “Not right now, not on round, not today. Some other time, maybe. But I’m not going to deal with this right now.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And yet I was destined to deal with it. During one of my flashes of fantastic, my brain popped out a plan that would cut my projected two years of chelation in half. If DMSA wasn’t in the picture, if there was something else I could take with the ALA to ease my mercury symptoms, something that didn’t kill my immune system and exacerbate yeast, I could chelate faster. If I chelated for five full days every other weekend instead of just three days and two nights, I could move through chelation in double-quick time. I could be done with it all by next Christmas.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This magic other chelator that acted like DMSA but didn’t cause yeast was not a figment of my desperate imagination. It existed, it was called DMPS, but I’d never even considered the possibility of taking it before because it required a prescription. Very few doctors knew enough about DMPS to feel comfortable prescribing it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At first, I planned on getting it from my holistic doctor. I knew he’d prescribed DMSA, but had he ever mentioned DMPS? Maybe not. Maybe I’d go in there and spend a couple hundred dollars on a wild goose chase.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But then an even better idea came to me. In Seattle, there was a Nurse Practioner called Julie Anderson who specialized in helping people chelate using the Frequent Dose Chelation protocol. She wrote prescriptions for DMPS all the time. People from all over the country traveled to Seattle to see her. She had a very workable system of meeting with a patient in person once, and then having phone sessions with them from then on. She ordered blood tests for people through their local labs, and filled prescriptions through the mail. It would have been expensive to fly to Seattle just to see her, but I’d been planning to take a trip to Seattle in January anyway. It would all work out perfectly.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Being on the holistic end of things, she had reams of intake questionnaires that I needed to fill out and fax to her before our first appointment. One of the questionnaires was from a book by a brain expert called Daniel Amen. The quiz was used to determine which, if any, parts of a person’s brain were malfunctioning and needed medication and support.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I asked my girlfriend to take the quiz with me. She would give me an outsider’s perspective on my symptoms, and I was also curious to see how she scored herself.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On the first 14 questions of the quiz, I scored pretty low, a lot of 0s and 1s for Never and Rarely. They covered things like short attention span, disorganization, being unable to estimate how long things might take. They were all pretty much the opposite of what I was like.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But my girlfriend beside me was racking up the points.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Procrastination?” I read. “My God, it’s your middle name! Can you give yourself a 5? It only goes up to 4? Well, definitely give yourself a 4.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then the quiz moved on to other brain areas, and the tables were turned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Has a tendency to hold onto own opinion and not listen to others.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Ha!” my girlfriend said. “Give yourself a 4. You do that all the time.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I do not!” I said. “I totally listen to others.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re doing it right now,” she insisted. “Give yourself a 4.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I am not!” I said. “You’re just wrong. I’m going to give myself a 0.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">After 40 or so questions, my girlfriend began to get restless.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How long is this thing, anyway?” she complained.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She made it through another few questions, then shot to her feet, saying, “This is boring,” and left the room. I looked at her scores. The only area she scored high on was ADD. It figured.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I finished the quiz and added up my scores. I was low on ADD, low on ADHD, but on each other area of the quiz, I scored very high. There was apparently something wrong with everything from my hypothalamus to my basal ganglia. This looked very bad. What did it mean?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I checked out the two Dan Amen books I found at the library and read them cover to cover. Here it was, right up in my face again, this idea that I had a mental illness. Scoring high in different areas of the quiz meant psychiatric diagnoses like OCD, borderline personality disorder, clinical depression. During all of my years of therapy, my therapist has refrained from diagnosing me. It was a policy that I had appreciated enormously. I didn’t want a label, and I definitely didn’t want to mask my true feelings by taking psychiatric drugs.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But now, besides my new symptoms that were clearly due to mercury like ‘has low energy’ or ‘is frequently irritable,’ there were things that I considered ‘just me’ chalked down as symptoms of mental illness. Some of them were problematic things that I had learned to work around like ‘quick startle reaction’ or ‘tendency to freeze in anxiety-provoking situations.’ But others were good. Weren’t they good? What could be bad about being superorganized or punctual or enjoying routine? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But as I watched others around me, observing them from this new perspective, I could see the price I paid for my punctuality and neatness. Others didn’t fret and obsess like I did. They could roll with change. They didn’t need to know in advance everything that was going to happen that day, that week, that year. Trying to get some perspective on how severe my ‘mental illness’ might be, I asked my friend Gwen to fill out the quiz. She was someone I considered normal. Was the quiz designed so that even normal people would score high in some area, just because of their personality?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I watched Gwen fill out the quiz. “No,” she kept saying. “Gosh, no, I don’t have that.” And I knew it was true, she wasn’t lying.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I’d given positive answers to more than half the questions in the quiz. Gwen couldn’t even scrape up 6 positive answers to the whole 71 questions.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">So I was a bit mentally ill. So what? Mercury had ripped through me in the dump phase and rearranged some of my marbles. It was what mercury did after all, it was a neurotoxin. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But the realization slowly sank in that mercury wasn’t just something that had screwed with my brain after amalgam removal. The self I’d had before I got my amalgams removed hadn’t been normal, it had been poisoned by mercury too. Come to think of it, I’d probably never been normal. I’d been poisoned by lead from the start, my brain impaired from day one by toxic metals.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My trip to Seattle rolled around and I finally got to go to my appointment with Julie Anderson. I didn’t hand over my Dan Amen brain quiz with the rest of my paperwork and she didn’t ask for it. It was something I wanted to handle myself, I wasn‘t ready to talk about it. We talked through my history, and I was very curious to hear her thoughts on gluten intolerance. Was it curable? Was it something that might go away with chelation? She said that we could find out more if I took an IgG blood test. That kind of allergy was much more likely to clear up than celiac disease.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We talked about supplements I could try, EpiCor to boost my immune system, molybdenum which was highly recommended to help with mercury symptoms, and kelp to give a little boost to my thyroid. She phoned in my prescription for 25mg capsules of DMPS, and delivered a stern warning.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“If you start to get a rash, stop taking it right away!” she said. “In a small number of people it causes an allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It starts with a rash, and ends up with your skin sloughing off.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Ew, really?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes really,” she said. “Keep an eye out for it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went home and when my DMPS arrived in the mail I tried out a weeklong round. I took it alone at first to see if I could tolerate it. My skin stayed intact, and I just felt extra tired after that first round. The next round was fine, I liked how DMPS caused much less redistribution than DMSA.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">For my next round, I added in ALA, and started to stretch how long I took it for. I no longer had to limit my rounds to control the yeast. DMPS didn’t have any effect on my immune system. I aimed for 5 days of ALA every other weekend, timed to overlap with my 7 day rounds of DMPS.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Things were mixed over the next couple of months. Julie ordered a set of hormone tests for me, and based on the results, I tried out DHEA and progesterone cream. It took time to sort out which of these new supplements were problematic and which were keepers. Molybdenum was awful, I couldn’t tolerate it at any dose. Lithium seemed good at first, but I found that it made me tired as time went by. EpiCor was supposed to fix my immune system and banish the yeast, but instead, it made me have neuropathy and gluten-type reactions to beans and cheese, foods I’d never had a problem with before. DHEA made new hairs sprout on my chin, even at a tiny dose. At the end of it all, I just stuck with the Adrenal Cortex, occasional kelp for my thyroid, and progesterone cream to banish my menstrual cramps.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Reading Dan Amen’s books had made me painfully aware of my nutty symptoms and what each one of them meant. The ones that seemed to damage my relationship most were the ones in the Cingulate Gyrus or ‘overfocus’ category. I was often uncontrollably anxious, single-mindedly obsessive, and over the past few months hadn’t been able to change gears and vary my topic of conversation at all. I was a great big chelation bore.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">If I was going to be honest, I had to admit that I couldn’t handle change gracefully in any area of my life. I hated surprises, and stuck to my routine like glue. This made me good at chelating, a focused and productive writer, but didn’t make me a lot of fun to live with, especially for my slightly ADD-esque girlfriend who liked to mix things up and enjoyed variety.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The worst part of my overfocus personality was that I used my girlfriend’s ‘flaws’ to vent my anxiety. I turned my laser-like focus on whatever I perceived she was doing wrong, and wouldn’t let up until she’d gotten a thorough understanding of how deeply she’d messed up. In the past, I’d thrown tantrums when she was ten minutes late for dinner, or had bought me the wrong kind of surprise gift. I hadn’t been able to control the anxiety then, and I still wasn’t able to control it now. I needed help.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The overfocus pattern was a mild form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It was caused by low serotonin levels, and according to Dan Amen, would respond beautifully to SSRIs. I wasn’t going to jump straight to taking Prozac, not after a lifelong personal stand against taking psychiatric drugs. But I did look very closely at Amen’s supplement recommendations for people with low serotonin. The least side-effecty one seemed to be inositol, a relative of the B vitamins. I’d done badly on B3 so I worried about having a bad reaction. But then again I’d done wonderfully on B12, so maybe inositol would be great. I bought a jar of the powder, and the next day, took the recommended quarter teaspoon with my breakfast.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t notice anything at first, maybe a slight sore throat. I went into my office and puttered around a bit, and then settled down at my computer to type up my daily to-do list. It was time to get to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I typed, <span class="italic">Go to the</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Then I found myself looking out the window at a bird in a branch.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">store for potatoes,</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> I continued. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Why had I paused? It wasn’t like my brain was foggy or forgetful.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Do the</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I picked up my paperweight and fiddled with it for a bit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">laundry.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Why was this going so slowly? My to-do list was something I banged out in sixty seconds unless I was feeling poorly and couldn’t hold a thought in my head. But my head was totally clear. My next sentence was even sitting there, all ready to go. I started it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Write 1,000 word on</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But I just didn’t seem to care very much about following through and getting the whole thing onto the screen. I kept on writing for a while, but this new mode of being my brain had entered was so strange and distracting. It was like my brain had turned into a wayward puppy, a distractible creature, uninterested in following my commands.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Wait. This was a familiar-sounding problem, but not because I’d ever experienced it. I jumped up to go find my girlfriend.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I think I have ADD!” I told her. “I took too much inositol and now when I try to write, it seems just as important to look out the window!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah that sounds right,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> “But I don’t think I can control it!” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Looking out the window is fun,” she said. “What’s the problem?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That dose faded, and over the next week or so, I found a more balanced effect on a much lower dose. It didn’t change my personality, suddenly turning me into an easygoing person. But it took the edge off my obsessions, giving me a little more room to move and breathe.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was around this time that the pain started. The morning after I ended my 40th round of chelation, I sat down in a chair and felt something give in my right hip. I tried to stand up, but the pain made me break out in a sweat. I sat for a while, waited, and then gingerly stood up. The throbbing pain faded after a while, but over the next weeks recurred if I did something as simple as bending down to tie my shoe.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And soon after that, a twitch began in my left eyelid. It felt like a flutter, and my vision would jump. At first I thought that others couldn’t see it, but I was talking to my girlfriend one day and she said, “Whoa! What’s up with your eye?” I tried to avoid eye contact with people when I could feel it happening.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The twitching was bad enough, but it soon grew into a dull ache under my cheekbone. This, on top of the hip problem was too much. I went for help.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Three days later, I was sitting in the local chiropractor’s office making chit chat at the beginning of my first session.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So what do you do?” he asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I told him I was a writer.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Cool,” he said. “What do you write about?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Mercury detox,” I said. “Chelation therapy.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh really?” he said. “Which kind?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Frequent Dose Chelation,” I said. “It’s based on a book by Andrew Hall Cutler called <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh yeah,” he said. “I’ve heard of that one.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Really?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, there was this guy who used to come in, one of my patients, who kept telling me all about that stuff. Mega doses of Alpha Lipoic Acid and vitamin C, right?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yup,” I nodded and smiled. “How’d the guy do?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh, so-so,” the chiropractor said. “He had a lot of problems. He swore by that protocol, though. He said it was great.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It is,” I agreed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And I’m sure it did make him feel better,” he said. “I mean, it makes sense. Pour enough antioxidants down a person’s throat and they’re bound to feel better for a while. But after this dude stopped taking them, he went downhill again.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I wondered what had gone wrong. Had he done it right? Had he gotten all of his amalgams out first? Had he made sure to chelate long enough? It was on the tip of my tongue to ask the chiropractor if he thought the guy had completed at least 50 or 60 rounds, but it was time to move on.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” the chiropractor said. “Why don’t you hop up on the table and we’ll see where we’re at.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My hip hurt more after my first session, but less after sessions two, three and four. I was able to hold the adjustments for longer and the pain was less frequent and not as sharp. Spring was in the air now, and the lease on our rental house was coming up for renewal. We were originally planning to buy a house in the area, but neither of us were in love with our sleepy rural village. My girlfriend and I sat down to discuss our options.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Does living here make you happy?” my girlfriend asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I shrugged. Happiness wasn’t something that I’d had much experience with since I’d left the city. Moving to this house had marked the beginning of my dump phase. I’d been sick for the whole two years we’d lived here.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We need to do what makes us happy,” she said. “What makes you happy?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Inositol?” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What else?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I stared blankly at her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What are you dreams?” she asked. “What do you want to do in this life?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That one was easy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“To chelate,” I said. “To get well.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And?” she prompted. “Besides that?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I shrugged. That was pretty much the focus of my whole life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m trying to find out if we should stay here,” she explained. “Or if we’d be happier somewhere else.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We could really move?” I said. “To a whole other place?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We can at least think about it,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We got out the map of the Metro North train lines. We crossed off all the undesirable places: all of Westchester, large cities, the richest towns in America, anything sited on a toxic waste dump, and towns we just plain didn’t like. There were four places left. One was called Beacon.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Then we should move to Beacon,” I said. “Someone said I’d like it there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Who?” my girlfriend said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Some woman,” I said, grasping at an incomplete memory. “I can’t remember who. She seemed very sure of it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Do you know anything about Beacon?” my girlfriend asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nope,” I said. “But I can look it up.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Over the next few weeks, I thought about the life I was leading in this house. Most of my time was spent alone. The only people I came in contact with were my girlfriend who I saw when she wasn’t at work, my therapist who I saw twice a month, and my girlfriend’s father who dropped by for tea once in a while. Then there were friends like Gwen, the couple over the border in Connecticut, and one other couple who lived an hour away. These friends I saw maybe once every month or two. I had the people I saw on Tuesdays at the farm program, and that was pretty much literally all the people I had in my life. It was pathetic.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I did some research about Beacon. It was on the river, right on the train line to the city, but half an hour closer than we were now. There was a big art museum there, and from the looks of the town’s social networking site, half of Brooklyn’s artists had migrated up there to enjoy the arty vibe. There were listings of social events, film screenings, board game nights, life drawing classes. It all looked like such fun. And the perfect place to start up a writing group.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As soon as I had that thought, I couldn’t let it go. I began to daydream about a whole other kind of life. One where I spent time with actual people, sitting around in coffee shops discussing our novels in progress. My girlfriend and I would host dinner parties. I’d go to board game nights. I’d spend my time at home during the day writing, but then at night, my social life would be full, there would always be someone to call, friends to hang out with.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My vision felt a bit delusional. When was the last time I’d made a friend? Really, on my own, without my girlfriend’s help? Did I honestly think that I could commit to starting a writing group while still chelating? Who would want to hang out with me, with my diseased overfocused mind and tired chelating body?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I don’t care, I thought. I want this. I want to have a normal life again. I’ll do what it takes. I’ll learn how.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I could see a road dividing in front of me with two options. All I’d done recently with my life was sit around and wait. I could either hide away in this house for the next few years, hoping that normality would be visited on me one day by the chelation gods, or I could make normality happen, I could go out and build the best life I could with the hand I was dealt.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I thought about the hand I had been dealt. My brain was still clearly impaired, but I wasn’t tortured like I’d been during the dump phase. I wasn’t mentally shut down like I’d been during the first year of chelation. I had lots of thoughts and feelings, they just were a bit crazy sometimes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">If I was going to live a real and normal life, I decided that I had to stop being afraid of myself. I had to stop shutting down what was going on inside me. I couldn’t keep closing the door on every negative or ‘crazy’ thought or feeling I had. I had to accept them and work with them. Non-mercury-toxic people sometimes had ‘crazy’ feelings too, and they lived with them and expressed them. Heck, most mercury toxic people expressed their crazy thoughts and feelings all the livelong day and nobody batted an eyelid. I’d BEEN one of those mercury toxic people once, back in the city before I’d gotten my amalgams removed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Well the time for change had come. If we were moving to a new house in a whole new town, then it was time to stop treating my mind like a can of socially toxic fumes. It was time to be myself, even if that self was a bit sick, and deal with the craziness as it came up. It was time to get out there and meet people and make friends and learn how to live a normal life.</span></span></span></p>
