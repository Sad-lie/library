<p class="calibre_33">  <a href="index_split_012.html#filepos132600">1</a>  T-72 operation: Atwater; Riley. Weiser 1994 quotes sources who suggested that the first T-72s were acquired (through Poland) only in 1987, by the CIA. But when I asked a knowledgeable former senior Pentagon official to confirm or deny that the first T-72 had been acquired sooner, perhaps around 1980, he simply declined to comment.</p>

Atwater and Riley provided some details of his RDF work, which McMoneagle himself was unwilling to discuss. Atwater also mentioned McMoneagle’s apparent lapses of memory regarding Vietnam.</p>

The official mentioned that the case was brought to him by someone in “law enforcement.” Given this and the other details of the case, it seems safe to infer that the tasking officer was from the FBI, which has the primary responsibility for the domestic tracking of Soviet spies. McMoneagle also remembered the case but didn’t provide details.</p>
