M<span><span class="calibre13">EL</span></span> R<span><span class="calibre13">ILEY</span></span> walked out of one of the RV rooms in 2560. He had just had a long session; he felt as if part of him were still at the target. He walked down the corridor, to the open room at the end, and out the door, exiting the ops building. A couple of the others were outside and watched as he walked out into the parking lot.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley sometimes looked this way after a session—zonked, <a id="filepos172910"></a>spaced out. On the other hand, he wasn’t aimless. Somewhere down in his mind, he knew where he was going. He kept walking, apparently oblivious of everything but his own inner guidance system. He was headed for the big metal trash dumpster, the Dipsy Dumpster, they called it. It was over to one side of the parking lot, where they threw all their garbage. Riley walked up to the dumpster and lifted its metal lid. With his free hand he reached into one of his trouser pockets, took out his car keys, and threw <a id="filepos173436"></a>them into the open maw of the dumpster. The keys disappeared with a little tinkling noise, sliding down amid the paper balls and tinfoil balls and dulled nail files and mostly-empty Pepsi cans and one or two Budweiser bottles and crushed lunch bags and old newspapers. Riley let the lid slam down, and then he turned toward building 2561.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The others were still watching him, and laughing. Poor Mel!</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Gradually Riley’s fog started to lift, until he noticed he was there in the parking lot, next to the Dipsy Dumpster, just having thrown his car keys in. The sun burned through, and it occurred to him that the last remote-viewing session perhaps had left him a little <em class="calibre4">too</em> spaced out. He had been a zombie. The business of the car keys had presumably been his subconscious’s way of telling him to forget about trying to drive anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Remote viewing’s aftereffects were more than a little bit like those of a hallucinogenic drug. Coming out of an intense session, walking outside, say, on a summer’s day, you would see the sky as, somehow, bluer. The grass would be greener—impossibly, effervescently green. A couple of birds on a wire could sound like a rain forest full of toucans and warblers. In the words of that old hallucinophile, Aldous Huxley, the “doors of perception” would be open a bit wider than usual. All that concentration on one’s inner, delicate, tenuous, semiconscious, barely perceptible experience—which was what remote viewing was—all of that forced the mind to focus harder. Afterwards, back in the real world, it would be as if the volume knobs on one’s sensory systems had been turned up, all the way. The usual trickle of sensory data was now a flood. <em class="calibre4">The greenness of that grass</em> … In a sense, it was a symptom of mental fatigue, but it wasn’t necessarily a bad feeling. It was like a perfectly mild dose of LSD. Everything was just bursting with gorgeous colors and sounds and tastes and smells and <a id="filepos175706"></a>textures. If the preceding RV session had gone well, if you had nailed the target, then so much the better. You had that extra electric tingle throughout your body. And you stared, and stumbled, and giggled, and shed tears for no reason. You “bounced off the walls,” as the remote viewers liked to say. The only experience Riley could compare it with was his first parachute jump in the Army; there had been so much adrenaline pumping in his system afterwards that even though he had come safely back to earth, and had been walking around, carrying his furled parachute, he almost hadn’t felt his feet touch the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">This kind of effect, it was thought, was only temporary. An hour or so after an intense RV session, the viewer would be as good as new. On the other hand, it was just possible that having a fairly deep altered-state experience almost every day, during daylight hours, could make your mind <a id="filepos176716"></a>more liable to slip into that state spontaneously, when you didn’t want to be in it. Perhaps it could even lead to psychiatric problems. Perhaps you wouldn’t be as good as new until you stopped remote viewing for a long period—and perhaps not even then.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It was this kind of concern that had moved the Army to categorize remote viewing in Grill Flame as human use experimentation. As part of the oversight process, which included a blizzard of consent forms and a medical review panel, the remote viewers had been introduced to Dr. Dick Hartsell, an INSCOM psychologist. Hartsell gave them some psychological tests, and interviewed them, ostensibly probing for any unsoundness of mind. But after that first round of interviews, early in 1978, Hartsell seemed to lose interest in the unit. Riley never saw him again. The rumor went around that Hartsell was simply spooked by the remote viewers, and wanted nothing more to do with them.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In early 1979, Islamic fundamentalists led by a gray-bearded cleric, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, took over <a id="filepos177933"></a>the government of Iran. The ousted Shah, Reza Pahlavi, who had made his country one of America’s staunchest allies in the Middle East, fled to America. On November 4 of that year, an Iranian mob invaded the U.S. Embassy in downtown Tehran, took the occupants hostage, and demanded that the Shah be returned.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Carter administration froze Iranian assets in the United States and cut off Iranian oil imports. The UN Security Council was mobilized to condemn the Iranian action and to demand the return of the hostages. The case was brought to the Court of International Justice, which also demanded the return of the hostages. The Shah, meanwhile, moved to an Air Force base in Texas, then to Panama, then to Egypt. No one seemed to want him, except for his former subjects, who seemed to want desperately to tear him limb from limb.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were other crises facing U.S. foreign policy makers at the time. Russia was invading Afghanistan. Vietnam, having just consolidated its grip on Cambodia, was invaded by China. Russia threatened war with China if China didn’t desist. Iraq, seeing opportunity in chaos, invaded Iran. Cuba decided to export tens of thousands of criminals in a massive boatlift to the United States. Yet the hostages in Iran seemed to obliterate all else on the radar screen of the American electorate. They were at once a national fixation, a symbol of further national humiliation in the wake of the Vietnam War, and above all, a symbol of the failure of the Carter presidency. Something had to be done.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The CIA apparently had an Iranian agent with some access to the embassy building and the hostages’ placement, but so far the Agency had kept him largely dormant, fearing that any activity or dissemination of his information would endanger his life. The bottom line was that there was very little known about the situation in the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The remote viewers were therefore kept busy. In late <a></a>1979 and early 1980 they were tasked by the Pentagon and National Security Council, literally hundreds of times, to provide information on the hostages’ whereabouts, their physical and mental states, the appearances and attitudes of their captors, and the layouts of the buildings where they were being held captive.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For Mel Riley and the others, it was gratifying to be part of such a key intelligence effort, but as they saw it, the Carter administration in its scramble to obtain information from remote viewers was going about it the wrong way. The remote-viewing taskings were relentless, with similar targets day after day. Remote viewers needed variety, to keep their minds from being cluttered with the same images. After a few weeks down in the zone with American hostages and ever-bearded Iranian guards—targets that were also constantly being depicted on TV at the time—Riley and others found it hard to see anything else, no matter what the target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">However, as winter turned to spring, Riley noticed that they were increasingly describing sites away from the hostages—urban buildings, sewer tunnels beneath the streets, government radio stations, and even remote desert locations. No one knew what any of this meant, other than that the administration still had Iran on its mind. An Air Force colonel now seemed to be the one providing the targets.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day in April 1980, Riley ran Hartleigh Trent in a remote-viewing session, and Trent began to describe American soldiers rappelling out of helicopters in the desert. Trent and Riley guessed that the target had been somewhere in Iran, and that the rappelling soldiers were commandos on a mission to rescue the hostages. Presumably the soldiers weren’t there yet, for it often happened that future or intended events drifted into remote-viewing data.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In any case, a few days later Scotty Watt gathered the six full- and part-time members of the unit together and told them to pack their bags. Within hours, they all had gathered <a></a>at a motel in the town of Laurel, not far from Fort Meade. Most of one floor had been set aside for them. Each viewer had one room to sleep and work, and there was a large suite for unit meetings.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Watt came in and confirmed that a covert mission to rescue the hostages was under way. Henceforth they would be remote-viewing targets related to the mission. To protect the security of the mission, and to keep them all from being tainted by images of the hostages they might see on TV, they were discouraged from leaving the motel until it was all over.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To Mel Riley, it seemed like a strange setup. The motel was part of a major chain, new-smelling and nicely carpeted, just renovated in fact, but the structure itself was much older. And it was completely infested with mice. Riley could hear them in the ceilings and the walls, and beneath the floorboards. Squeaking ghosts. They were all over the place.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Not long after the unit’s sequestration had begun, Riley went over to Hartleigh Trent’s room, to monitor him for a session. He turned out the lights, and Trent lay down and quieted his brain. Minutes later, Trent was drifting along, watching the images flicker past, checking out the main radio station in Tehran, or whatever it was, and Riley was trying to monitor him, very quietly, very patiently, quiet questions, no sudden noises. And Riley began to notice that with the lights off, the mice had really come to life. They were dancing around in the ceiling, making all kinds of scurrying and scuffling noises. After a while, some of them were bold enough to venture out into the room. One of the mice hit Riley’s shoe, and decided to climb it. Then he climbed up Riley’s sock, the tiny claws digging into the cotton. Then the little fellow started up Riley’s leg, inside his trousers. The mouse made it up to Riley’s knee before Riley reached down and shook it out, and all the time, Riley—laid-back Riley—didn’t let on, didn’t make a sound, <a></a>so that Hartleigh Trent could continue to float along to the noiseless rhythms of the ethereal zone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To Riley, the mice were far from the worst things about the hostage rescue affair. The worst things were the monotony and the brutal pace of the remote viewing. Just as it had been in the months after the hostage crisis began, whoever was tasking them didn’t seem to have a clue to how remote viewing worked. There had been operations in the past when a viewer had had to do two or three sessions per day on the same kind of target. That was trying enough, but to do more than that invited severe burnout. Now they were remote-viewing virtually non-stop, around the clock.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To the Air Force colonel running the taskings, the idea of becoming mentally burned out after lying on a couch in a semi-conscious state for an hour might have sounded absurd, like some crazy New Age form of malingering. But to the remote viewers, it was as real as anything they did. It was a barrier like the one long-distance runners sometimes hit. As you approached this barrier, Riley and the others believed, your RV data turned to garbage, and when you hit it, you were like someone who hadn’t slept for days; the necessary neurotransmitters had dried up, burned up. You were apt to become emotionally fragile, and you acquired a certain vacant stare.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Attacking target after target, again and again, the remote viewers soon bounced off this wall, the parts of their minds that worked during RV slowly collapsing from exhaustion. Imagination flooded in. Making it all worse was the fact that they had no feedback. They had no idea how well, or how badly, they were doing. To Riley and some of the others, this was another guarantee of failure.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On the morning of April 25 word came in that President Carter was about to make a speech on television. The unit turned on the set in the meeting room, and there was Carter, ruefully spelling it out: the rendezvous site at Desert One, the mechanical failure of several helicopters, the collision <a></a>of two aircraft in the desert, the eight deaths, the horrific injuries, the whole debacle.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A number of them swore quietly. The young INSCOM analyst Nancy Stern began to cry, unleashing a torrent of anger, fuck this, fuck that, fuck the mission planners, fuck Carter, fuck Fate. In the weeks that followed, she left the unit. Soon afterward Rhode Islander Fern Gauvin also left the unit, vowing never to remote-view again.</p>
<p class="calibre_23"><a id="filepos187658"></a>Jackie Keith, the INSCOM special ops man, had dropped out not long after being selected for the original Gondola Wish team. But he still came by now and then to task the remote viewers with targets related to his own operations. He was always running around somewhere or other in his sports car, a Datsun 280-Z, living what seemed to be a muted Army-civilian version of the James Bond life.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As 1980 wore on, Keith and the remote viewers became involved in the Carter administration’s plans for a second hostage rescue mission in Iran. In the wake of the first rescue attempt, the hostages had now been dispersed; one of the main tasks now was to find where they all were.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day Keith was in the control room in building 2560, listening in while Mel Riley ran Hartleigh Trent against some hostage-related target. Trent was drifting along in his zone. Riley had on headphones and was listening to Keith’s instructions on what questions to ask. Suddenly Riley heard a heavy thud in the headphones. The thud also came through the wall, jolting Trent out of his trance. Both Trent and Riley went to the control room and found Jackie Keith sprawled on the floor. Heart attack—no pulse. Trent ran to get a phone, and Riley started CPR. McMoneagle came in and helped him until the paramedics arrived. They hit him with the defibrillators all the way to the hospital, but it was no use. Riley and the others could hardly believe it. Keith was only in his late thirties; he had just married, and his young widow was pregnant with his first child. It was a <a></a>tragedy without an explanation. After the paramedics had left, Atwater carried Keith’s briefcase into Watt’s office. Keith had been headed to New York, on one of his many operations. In the briefcase was a several-thousand-dollar payoff for some now-orphaned secret agent.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">President Carter, worried that intelligence on the hostages’ locations was too unreliable, eventually decided not to make a second rescue attempt. In the final humiliation, the hostages were released the moment his presidency ended. The remote viewers received a slap in the face too when the <a id="filepos190044"></a>Air Force colonel debriefed them on what their intense work had achieved. He told them, with what seemed to be deliberate ambiguity, that their data had been “no worse” than the intelligence collected by more conventional methods.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Military officers and enlisted personnel are generally expected to move from one posting to another every three years. By early 1981, a <a id="filepos190505"></a>sea change was under way at the remote-viewing unit. The full-time military personnel—Watt, Atwater, Bell, McMoneagle, and Riley—all faced possible transfers elsewhere in the world. Even the unit’s chief protector, Major General Thompson, was headed for a transfer out of his Pentagon office. Watt and Atwater meanwhile were searching for new recruits and were working with researchers out at SRI to develop improved techniques for psychic spying.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the end, Grill Flame’s managers managed to keep a nucleus of original members in place at the unit. Atwater was allowed to stay on. McMoneagle, the anchor of the remote-viewing team, was only a tour away from reaching twenty years’ service—retirement time—and was also allowed to remain. Ken Bell arranged to stay, but would leave within a year to rejoin the regular Army career track. He would retire in the late 1980s as a lieutenant colonel.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Under different circumstances, Mel Riley would have <a></a>liked to stay at Fort Meade too. Remote viewing, and the activities surrounding it, were as near to his ideal occupation as he could imagine. When orders came in sending Riley to a posting near Wiesbaden, his old haunt and his wife’s hometown, Atwater and officials higher up in the program could have easily changed them. But Riley didn’t want them to. He saw that the unit was on relatively firm ground now, with an increasing budget and a new generation of recruits on the way. It wasn’t going to disappear anytime soon, and Atwater made clear that he could come back whenever he wanted. Riley decided he would go to Germany for three years, back to warm beer and the real, live Cold War. And when his tour there ended, he promised himself, he would return.</p>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_22"></div>
