<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We went to check out Beacon and instantly fell in love with it. I looked for houses to rent and made an appointment to go see one, an elegant Victorian a short walk from the train station and Main Street where all the shops were. The landlord, an artist, gave us the tour, and one bright airy room upstairs caught my writer’s heart.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“This would be my office,” I said immediately.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What?” my girlfriend said. She hadn’t even made it into the room yet.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“This one’s mine,” I said. “You can’t have it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh, fine,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My only misgiving about the house was all the climbing I would have to do. Unlike our old house, this one had stairs. And was situated at the top of a very steep hill. And besides that, there were two sets of steep outdoor stairs to climb to get to Main Street. When we left the house and took a stroll over to Main Street to look at the health food store, I huffed and puffed, hauling myself up the stairs. And then there was long, long Main Street to get down. It was nice to have everything within walking distance, but that actually meant doing some walking. I was glad that there were benches strategically situated all along Main Street, and I eagerly flopped down onto one to rest as we made our way to the store. Once there, I made a mental list of all of the gluten free goodies I would buy once we moved in. I didn’t know how I would make it up that final hill to the house carrying a bag of shopping, but there was parking all along Main Street. It wouldn’t be weird if I drove everywhere.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Packing up the whole house for our move was easy on good days and hard on bad days. I either whipped through 25 boxes in an afternoon, or struggled to get done with even one. But it all got done in the end, and the movers came and dropped it all off at the other end, and the long process began again, but in reverse. I was aware now of my girlfriend’s ADD issues, and having more energy than I’d had in a while, I took charge of the unpacking process. I wanted us to unpack right this time. I wanted us to resist the urge to just plop things in the first place that came to mind. I wanted this new house to be organized, to be as close to perfect as possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had counted all of the boxes, and had added up my estimates of how long each organizational task would take. If we worked efficiently, there were a few short weeks of work ahead of us. But of course my girlfriend’s amazing powers of procrastination could turn that into months.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I laid it all out for her, explaining that we needed to focus.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So I can’t do anything except go to work and unpack?” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s right.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But I want to go to the library,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, you can’t.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Where can I go?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We brokered a deal where she was allowed to go to the grocery store, hardware store, and the bank, but only if necessary.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Just make sure you unpack at least ten boxes a day, alright?” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s a lot of boxes,” my girlfriend grumbled.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’ll benefit from this too,” I said. “Don’t you think it’ll be good for you to have a house that’s really organized?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Fine, fine,” she said, walking away.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We barely had time to speak to each other over the next few weeks. We spent every free moment unpacking and working on the house. I kept an eye on my girlfriend, making sure that she was doing her share and doing it right. The house was shaping up nicely, but we still had a ways to go. I wondered how long until my girlfriend would tire of all this and start shirking her duties.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Things came to a head with the fish soup. I couldn’t understand why my girlfriend had arrived home with two pounds of frozen hake one day. She was a vegetarian and hadn’t eaten fish in sixteen years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It was leftover from my boss’s Seder,” she said. “I think I know what I want to make…”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She continued to go on about the fish and how she was going to cook it, but I could see that this was some kind of procrastination ploy on her part. We were supposed to be unpacking, not messing around with fish she probably didn’t even want to eat. A couple of days passed, and I decided to take care of the fish myself, and turned it into a quick soup.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend came home in the middle of the cooking.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Making fish soup,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But I told I was going to cook that fish!” she said. “I have a recipe! We had a long conversation about it!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We did?” I said, guilt washing over me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Don’t you remember?” she asked. “We went back and forth and then we finally decided we’d cook it together. I was really looking forward to it!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t remember. When I tried to recall conversations about the fish, all I got was my own voice-over, <span class="italic">Get rid of the fish so we can unpack, unpack, unpack!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend stormed out of the house and sat on the porch and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the long evening.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The rest of the weekend went pretty much just as badly. When we were working on setting up the garden, my girlfriend said how she was planning to plant corn, beans and squash in the ‘three sisters’ formation by the back fence, but with perennial versions of the plants that she’d have to find online and get shipped to us. I was wise to this kind of ADD talk. Lots of my girlfriends ‘plans’ never came to fruition.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So is this something you’re going to do for real?” I asked. “Or should I have a backup plan for that part of the garden?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She exploded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I am sick of you,” she spat out, “and your need to piss in every corner of this house! We have been unpacking for three solid weeks! I have had enough of your controlling and nitpicking! I’d rather be alone that deal with this kind of attitude!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was a horrible shock to experience such anger from someone who was usually so calm and accepting. I ran into the house and locked myself in the bathroom and had a good cry. Why had things gone so horribly wrong?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was tempting to blame it all on mercury, to say that the mercury monster had caused this fight, and if I just zipped the lip and kept the monster under control, everything would be fine. But the truth was, there was no mercury monster. There was just me. I had to take responsibility for what I’d done.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was rusty at this, I could almost hear the hinges in my brain creak as I approached my girlfriend later that night and said, “We have to talk.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was scary to talk to her about my negative feelings. Was this going to destroy everything? Even though I cried a lot during the conversation, it didn’t feel like a hopeless descent into mentally ill misery. It was a true communication of how I felt. I could feel her at the other end of the line, understanding me, hearing me. And when she spoke, I listened hard.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You have to stop bossing me around,” she said. “And I want no more of that mechanistic bullshit about what vitamins you want me to take. It’s all you ever talk about. I accept other people for who they are. I never ask you to change. Can’t I have even a fraction of that attitude returned to me?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It dawned on me how poorly I’d listened to her, what a bad partner I’d been. Yet in the end, I felt closer to her than I had in a long time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As the rounds passed, my body felt stronger. After the unpacking push, I didn’t need to take a week in bed to recover. I kept going. I happily trotted up and down all the stairs and hills that I’d worried about when we first moved in. One day, I even surprised myself by wanting to run up a flight of stairs. It was fun. There was a spring in my step that I hadn’t felt in ages. My body was definitely getting well. It was just my mind that still needed some help.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One good conversation with my girlfriend didn’t make everything better. I struggled in this new place of taking all of my feelings seriously, both good and bad. Sometimes something upsetting would happen, and I would feel awful! And I was expected to sit with this feeling and process it and write in my journal about it and act on it? Sometimes it went on for hours, days. How could a person feel this bad about trivial nonsense for so long? It had to be the mercury talking. But I held on, and eventually it always passed, and I felt glad that I’d stuck it out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">All through that first summer in Beacon, I worked on making a healthy connection with my feelings. It was a summer when my girlfriend was away for a month traveling with her family, and then another month for work. This was good, because I got to practice being around some difficult feelings without having to interact with anyone. But being left at home so much didn’t make me happy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When she came home from her second trip, I told my girlfriend, “We have to talk.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I wanted to share my true feelings with her. The biggest of these feelings was anger. I cried and berated her for neglecting me, for not including me in her plans, for seeing me as some sick appendage she could just park at home while she went off having fun.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t let it go. I was so unhappy, and needed to make her unhappy too. After a long fight where it felt like nothing was resolved, just bad feelings dumped all over her, I began to despair. How could this help? I was poisoning our relationship. I should zip the lip and let it go.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Bet you wish I’d go back to the way I was when I was sick,” I said. “When I was quiet and just stayed out of your way and didn’t badger and harangue you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t want to go back to that for one second.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Why not?” I said. “It wasn’t like you were the one who was sick.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I wasn’t sick,” she said. “But do you think it was fun for me? Right now, you’re totally crackers, you’re a great big pain in my ass, but at least you’re not ignoring me. Do you know what it’s like to live with someone who’s sick and miserable and won’t talk to you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I shook my head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s not good,” she said. “Not good at all.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Things were slowly getting better inside my home, but there was the wide world to contend with too. Living in Beacon, there was always something going on, several nights a week. I had more social engagements in one month than I’d had the whole two years I’d been sick. I started the writing group I’d dreamed about, and we met every week at a local wine bar. Besides that, there was the book club, the science fiction book club, gallery openings, two different board game nights, and best of all, dinners and parties at the houses of the circle of awesomely cool lesbians we had met since we’d arrived.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I found myself drawn to the kinds of people I would have considered ‘above me’ or ‘too together’ before. Back in the city, I had made a lot of friends who had been sick in one way or another. We’d had a lot in common, and looking back, I suppose that that thing was mercury poisoning. But now I didn’t want to seek out people who were sick. I had nothing to learn from them. I wanted to befriend healthy people. I wanted to spend time with them, to let them model to me how people behaved whose lives weren’t ruled by mercury. They seemed happy to welcome me into their lives, and I took notes on what ‘normal’ looked like these days.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One of the first things I did to fit in a little more was to stop taking the jumbo old-lady pill minder with me when I went out to dinner. I rearranged my regimen so that I took the bulk of my supplements with breakfast, and any twice-a-day extras with lunch, plus a top-up at bedtime. It was weird enough that I was always the only person at the table who was gluten free. I wanted to be able to sit in a restaurant with the book club and not have to also explain about my supplements.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It felt very freeing to appear more normal, but as more long rounds of ALA went by, my brain seemed to be taking a turn for the worse. I had met a lot of new people over the summer in Beacon, and I now feared being in situations where I would have to introduce people to each other. I was having a problem recalling people’s names. I hadn’t forgotten them, I just couldn’t bring them to mind fast enough to be useful.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Parties began to be stressful to me. The writing group got harder too. People’s names weren’t the only problem, now ordinary words seemed harder and harder to summon. I felt like I was beginning to sound like a half-wit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I sat at a party once beside my girlfriend, talking to another couple.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I hate that thing,” I said. “You know, that thing where you can’t say the words?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean?” my girlfriend asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“There’s a word for it,” I struggled. “Where you can’t choose the right words, and you’re all stupid-sounding.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh, you mean ‘inarticulate,’” one of the women said, laughing.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Thank you,” I said. “I hate that I’m so inarticulate.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh you’re funny,” the other woman said. “What’s the word for when you can’t find the word,” she mimicked. “Too cute!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I knew she thought I had been joking, and I laughed along, but the tedious truth was that it wasn’t a joke.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The months went by and I began to wonder if this was just how chelation worked. As my body grew stronger and more resilient, I paid the price by having my mental faculties eaten away. I tried not to worry about it too much. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t making me depressed or unhappy, it had just turned me into a total airhead.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was making a lot of progress making friends with normal people. My girlfriend and I started getting regular invitations to eat at people’s houses. We always accepted, but then came the awkward negotiation where I tried to gauge their interest in really learning about gluten. It was a hidden ingredient in so many foods. It was so easy to contaminate a dish with it while cooking. I really didn’t like asking these people I barely knew to do all this work just for one little dinner.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And was there really a need for me to keep eating gluten free? What if it wasn’t an issue for me anymore, but I just didn’t know it?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The IgG allergy test Julie Anderson had ordered for me when I’d seen her in Seattle had come back negative for gluten. But this didn’t mean that I was in the clear. There were all kinds of different ways that the immune system could be damaged, resulting in a gluten allergy. Celiac disease apparently generated a whole other set of antibodies, and these could be detected in a different blood test. I was curious to see if I’d come up positive if I took this one. I spoke to Julie about it on the phone.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“The celiac blood test is pretty accurate at testing specifically for the presence of celiac antibodies,” she said. “I can order it for you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That would be great,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But you do realize,” she said, “that you’re going to have to eat gluten beforehand to produce the antibodies. Being strictly gluten free for a long time means they’ve cleared out of your system.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes, I know,” I said. “Do I have to eat it for more than one day?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No!” she said. “Just once. Just a little will cause enough of a reaction. Take it easy, okay?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two days before the blood test, it was very very strange to open up my girlfriend’s box of Wheat Chex and actually touch it on purpose. I generally avoided touching other people’s gluten in case invisible crumbs stuck to my fingers and made their way into my system.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took one little square of cereal and put it in my mouth, resisting the urge to wipe my hand on my shirt to get the hidden gluten crumbs off. Nothing could stop the contamination now, the wheat was inside me. I chewed the little gluten bomb, blown away by how incredibly <span class="italic">wheaty</span> it tasted. It was a flavor I hadn’t encountered in years. Mercury must have erased my ‘wheat’ file, it tasted so weird and foreign to me now.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went on with the rest of my day, feeling fine, but knowing in the back of my mind that bad things were on their way. My usual pattern was to not feel any gluten symptoms until the morning after I ate it, so I didn’t make any sudden moves when I woke up. I braced myself for a foul mood, neuropathy, tunnel vision, everything I’d experienced the last time I’d been glutened. How bad was it going to be? Was it going to be worse, as the literature on celiac disease suggested it would be, symptoms increasing in severity the longer a person refrained from eating gluten? Or would my secret hope be realized? Would chelation have done its magic and freed me of this terrible burden of gluten intolerance?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I sat up. I turned my head, wiggled my fingers and toes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And laughed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt fine. My mood was fine. My vision was normal. I stood up and walked around. Yes, if I paid attention, I noticed a little neuropathy in the fingers of my left hand. Nothing too alarming, just a slight numbness. And the left side of my scalp felt a bit funny too. It wasn’t quite a headache, it wasn’t quite numb, it was just an odd sensation that made me aware it felt different to the rest of my head. And that was it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt the tiniest hint of disappointment that I wasn’t a hundred percent cured, but mostly, I felt very very grateful. This was such an enormous improvement.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I wasn’t going to rush out and start eating gluten again, but if this was all it was going to do to me, I didn’t have to live in terror of it anymore. I could relax about eating at people’s houses. Even if someone screwed up and contaminated my food, it wouldn’t be a big deal.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The result of the celiac blood test came back. It was negative.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> “That doesn’t mean you can eat gluten,” Julie Anderson warned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“As long as you’re having symptoms, you should stick with the gluten free diet.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I still had no idea how gluten was affecting my immune system. And yet I felt very cheerful about my progress. Chelation had made 95% of my gluten symptoms go away. Maybe one day, when chelation was done, I’d make it all the way to a 100%.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The gluten mystery remained unsolved, but the case of the inarticulate foggy-brained lesbian got cleared up the following month. I was reading about copper toxicity, something that often went along with heavy metal poisoning. Because of liver problems, mercury toxic people often ended up retaining too much copper. The symptoms of copper toxicity and mercury toxicity were practically indistinguishable, except for the fact that in women, copper toxicity caused PMS. Taking vitamin C, and especially zinc with meals was a sure-fire PMS remedy. The zinc competed with copper in the gut for absorption, automatically lowering its levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I found this information interesting. It was something that every woman should know. It wasn’t relevant for me, because my PMS days had ended the moment I’d had my amalgams removed. Suffering through two days of foggy-brained misery every single month was a thing of the past.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Or was it?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I scrabbled through my papers and took out my latest temperature chart. I counted up the days since my cycle had started, took out my diary and correlated the dates. This month, yes, I’d had an emotional drama that had seemed very important at the time, but had resolved itself with the arrival of my period. And last month too, I’d had those couple of tearful days that fell right before my period started. And all of this spaciness that had been going on for months. Could it be? Was it possible that it wasn’t mercury, but copper?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Of course it was. I’d been chelating hard with ALA for months. People who chelated intensely with ALA had to keep an eye on their copper levels, because one of the side effects of ALA was a tendency to hold onto copper. How had I forgotten that? And a few months ago, I’d gone and stopped taking my supplements with dinner, absorbing extra copper because the supplements didn’t compete with it for absorption. No wonder my copper levels had gone so high.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Fixing copper toxicity was very easy. Taking vitamin C and zinc with meals would clear it up in a month or so. But I was tired of being pulled through the wringer. I’d just passed the threshold of 100 days of ALA chelation. I decided to take a couple of rounds off to let my copper levels fall.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Going off ALA was daunting. I was at round 54 now. I had chelated like clockwork every other weekend since the ‘autistic’ fiasco in London at round 18. I decided it would be safer not to stop chelating entirely. I would continue as usual taking DMPS without the ALA.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I kind of held my breath through that first round when I was skipping ALA. But I didn’t experience any ill-effects. In fact, I started to feel great. The excess copper started to clear out of my system, and suddenly, I felt fine. I could think clearly, remember effortlessly. I wasn’t a woolly-headed inarticulate mess anymore. I took a second round off, and the clarity continued. I reveled in my smartness, and couldn’t help crowing over the ass-kicking I dealt out when we played Scrabble at board game night.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When it was time to go back on ALA, it chafed terribly to return to the inevitable spaciness. But intellectually, I knew that I was doing the right thing. I would thank myself later for making this sacrifice. I just had a few more months to go before crossing the threshold of 150 days of ALA chelation. It would only be 40 rounds of ALA chelation for me, but because most of my rounds that year had been supersize 5-day rounds, I had started counting days instead of rounds. 150 days was my shining goal, my equivalent of 50 regular-sized rounds, the threshold I had been pining to cross since I’d started ALA chelation 18 months before.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was still taking my trips into the city every other week to see my therapist, but even though the train journey was shorter, I began to resent the time it was taking away from my writing and the rest of my busy new life. I’d begun to wonder why exactly I was going all the way into the city and paying all this money to see her. Now that my head had cleared, it seemed like the only thing that was wrong with my life was that I was chelating. Everything else was the best it had ever been. Did I really need to pay someone a hundred and fifty dollars to hear how my life was going well? I liked my therapist a lot, but I figured that one of these days, I was going to have to give her the boot.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next time I went into see her, I was on round, feeling the all-too-familiar feeling that I was trapped in a well, physically walking among the normal people, but miles away from them in my own mercury world.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know it’s not true,” I said, “But it feels like I’ve felt like this forever.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She nodded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s like a day, an hour in this place takes forever,” I said. “No. It’s more like this place exists in another time, not the time that ordinary people occupy. And I have days in that ordinary time too. But then I come back here again, and it’s eternal.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I think what you’re describing is a thing called state memory,” she said. “When you move into a certain state, you can’t access the memory of ‘ordinary time’ as you call it. So every time you’re in there, all you can remember is what it felt like to be there the last time you were there, and the time before, and before that. So it feels eternal, even if it objectively lasts for a very short time.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes,” I said. “Exactly. That’s what it is. State memory.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So, you seem to be doing well in your new home, doing your writing…”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“…and making new friends.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded and smiled.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It feels like a new phase is beginning for you,” she said. “Something more stable. And I wondered what direction you wanted to take things in here. In your sessions.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Oh boy, here it was, the moment I’d been putting off.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> “We could work on the memory states you’re finding yourself in,” she said. “Like right now.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I sighed, and tears began to flow out of my eyes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What came up there?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I opened my mouth, but it took a moment to frame the words.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m not going to work on those states,” I said. “Here with you. Chelation ends soon, the states will end along with it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It may not be that simple…” she began.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Listen to me,” I said, crying harder. “What I’m trying to tell you is that this is it. For now. This is our last session.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Tears sprang up in her eyes too. Our bond was deep. She may not have understood every nuance of what my sickness meant, but she’d been a witness to it. She had sat with me through the worst.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m not sick anymore,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was terrifying to make such a bold statement. But I truly meant it. Physically, mentally, emotionally, chelation had changed everything. I was no longer an injured bird that needed her care.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know I’m not perfect,” I said. “But I can do this. I know I can live my life. Like a normal person. You know?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know,” she said, and wiped her eyes. “And you know my door is always open. Just call and you can come back any time. I would love to see you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She stood up. “Let me give you a hug?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I fell into her arms and wept some more. And then I dried my eyes, blew my nose, and went out and began my new life as a normal person.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two days later, it was my birthday. I was thirty five years old. It was a year since I’d had that miraculous round where music had returned to my life, when I’d known for sure that ALA worked. Two years since the darkest days of the dump phase, when I’d reached out and found the stories of other mercury toxic people and begun to chelate.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I spent my birthday with my girlfriend at a baseball game. We were neither of us big fans, but she’d gotten free tickets at work, and it sounded like a fun day out. Except of course, I wasn’t having any fun. I was on round, and ALA’s effect on my brain seemed especially strong. I sat in my seat, far above the field, and pretended to be engrossed in the game so that I wouldn’t have to navigate the conversation going on between my girlfriend and her co-workers.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But in reality, I wasn’t following the game at all. I was struggling because ALA was distorting my perception of reality. When I looked at the field, I couldn’t shake the belief that I was watching the game on a screen. Reality had become kind of flat and two-dimensional. This had happened to me before, but it hadn’t been this strong. The effect was magnified when I looked up at the actual screen that the game was being shown on. I tried to break the spell by putting my head down and closing my eyes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Are you okay?” my girlfriend asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I should take a walk,” I said. “Come with me?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We navigated the steep steps, and spent some time walking back and forth between the snack food vendors and the bathrooms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m sorry,” I said. “Would it be okay if we went home?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Don’t apologize,” she said. “It’s your birthday, not mine.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I just hate this,” I burst out. “It’s horrible!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Poor pet,” she said. “But it will pass soon, right? You’ll be fine again in no time.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She was right. The next day, I felt much more grounded, and by the time the round ended, I was totally fine. But it bothered me that just a couple of months from my arbitrary finish line, I was still having intense chelation symptoms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That wasn’t how it was supposed to go. On the Frequent Dose Chelation protocol, there was no official number of rounds that a person was supposed to complete. The guideline was that chelation should continue six months past the point that ALA provoked no more mercury symptoms on round. I suspected that most of my reaction to ALA had more to do with its high thiol content than any mercury it was stirring up, but chelation should normalize my thiol levels too, ending those symptoms. I was nowhere near symptom-free, and yet I was planning soon to stop. Was I being stupid? Maybe the arbitrary finish line of 150 days on ALA was a bad idea.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Near the end of my next round, on my 110th day of chelation with ALA, I woke up feeling a little itchy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Maybe this is it! I thought. Maybe this is finally the Stevens-Johnson syndrome that Julie Anderson talked about!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The thought filled me with glee. I examined my skin to see if it was showing any signs of sloughing off, but to my disappointment it was totally intact and blemish free.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Nevertheless, I launched into an elaborate fantasy where I called up Julie Anderson in distress.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Oh Julie,</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> I’d say, <span class="italic">I really really really want to keep on chelating, but I think I’m starting to have a reaction to DMPS.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Then you must stop!</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> Julie would say. <span class="italic">Stop chelating now! Forevermore you must stay away from DMPS and all other chelators! Do you understand me? Never chelate again!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But my itchiness faded away, and I got up and started my day of work.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As I wrote, my mind began to wander and I started thinking about my girlfriend. The fact that I was chelating had an effect on her life too. It wasn’t just about me. Was it fair to subject her to all of these alarms in the middle of the night? Make her leave the baseball game early? Ask her to do all the driving when I felt spaced out?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Maybe I should call her up at work and tell her that I was willing to stop chelating right now for the sake of our relationship.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I caught myself and gave myself a little mental shake. This was ridiculous, I had to snap out of it. But the truth was that I couldn’t. It kept surfacing in my mind in different forms, this nagging thought that I needed to quit chelating.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Okay, I thought. I’m not going to suppress this train of thought, I’m going to engage with it and process.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Hello little train of thought,</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> I said to myself. <span class="italic">Why should I quit chelating now? Why today?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Why two months from now, in December?</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2"> it countered. <span class="italic">It’s all arbitrary. Quitting in October versus quitting in December, who cares? Nobody is watching.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I turned this idea over in my mind for the rest of the day. Was this train of thought voicing something negative? Was it speaking from a place of sickness, should I ignore it? But what if it was perfectly reasonable? What if it was making perfect sense?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It seemed like a revolutionary idea, to change a deadline that had been set in stone for so long. Was I ready to abandon the idea of the 50 or 60 round golden turning point? How could I expect the recoveries that other people had seen if I didn’t chelate as fully as they did? I had busted a gut over the past year to squeeze in as many days as I could on ALA. But my 110 days still only represented forty something standard-sized rounds. What if I stopped and it turned out that I wasn’t really done? What if it was a terrible mistake?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I thought about my therapist, not because I wanted to call her up to ask her what to do. Instead, I turned over the memory of the last thing she said to me. <span class="italic">You can always come back. My door is always open. </span>I knew that she was going to say those words even before they came out of her mouth. It was one of the things that made it possible for me to stop seeing her. Quitting therapy was never a forever decision. If I needed her, she was there.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I realized that chelation was the same. If I quit now, it didn’t have to mean that I would never chelate again. If the mercury symptoms returned, chelation was always there for me. I could pause chelation for six months and see what happened. If it was clear at that point that I needed more, then I’d go back on round.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was then that I picked up the phone and called my girlfriend. I ran the plan past her to see if it sounded reasonable. Did she think I was just being a quitter?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How long have you chelated for?” she asked me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I cast my mind back. I’d begun chelation soon after I’d turned 33. “Almost two years,” I said. “I guess it will be two years in a couple of weeks.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And how many rounds have you done?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This information was sitting right in front of me in my planner.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“This is round 60,” I said. “But I haven’t done 60 rounds of ALA. That’s really the only kind of chelation that counts.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It doesn’t matter,” she insisted. “You have chelated like a dog for two years. You absolutely deserve a break. Your plan is a good one. Okay?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” I smiled.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And so I stopped. The first weekend off chelation coincided with a visit from family. My sister, her husband and two children came from London to spend Halloween with us. My girlfriend and I had the week planned out: the local Halloween Parade, pumpkin carving, apple picking for the kids. A screening of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and nights out at some nice restaurants with good gluten-free menus for the adults.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We went all-out, ran around having a good time. It was a great visit. On the last night, my sister sat in the living room with me and my girlfriend, quizzing us about our travel plans. She was always going somewhere herself, and liked to rope other people in too whenever she could.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well,” my girlfriend said, “We were sorta talking about going to New Zealand.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This was a trip that had been on the back burner for a long time. It was to be our kind-of honeymoon, but there was no point in even thinking about going until I was well enough to face such a long flight.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Lovely!” my sister said. “How exciting. You should go in March. I’ll be in Australia for a wedding. You can just hop over from New Zealand and we’ll meet up.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend and I looked at each other.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” I said. “If we should make any firm plans.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, probably not,” my girlfriend said. “Maybe we won’t end up going. Not this year, anyway.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Wow,” my sister said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen two people less enthusiastic about booking a trip to New Zealand. What’s up? Is it a thing where one of you wants to go and the other doesn’t?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, I want to go,” I said. “But I’m afraid that I’d be sick while I was there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My sister looked at my girlfriend.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, I totally want to go too,” she said. “But I’m also afraid that Áine’d get sick.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sick?” my sister said. “Look at you, you’re fine. Running around after us all week like a lunatic. There’s nothing wrong with you.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re seeing me here. At home,” I said. “With all my little gluten free foods, and all my little supplements and pills. Remember London? When I didn’t have my DMSA? That’s the kind of thing I’m talking about. What’s the point of traveling half way across the world, and then lying around like a lump not being able to enjoy it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My sister looked at me like I was crazy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Then just bring along all your pills!” she said. “People get sick when they travel, they take a day in bed, and they get better. It’s not a reason to stay home.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I dunno,” I said. “There’s jet lag and everything…”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh please,” she said. “What‘s the time difference to New Zealand? Five or six hours? Going west, that’s easy. I’m facing twelve hours between London and Australia, no matter which way I go. Don’t sit there complaining to me about jet lag!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s a long flight…” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My sister rolled her eyes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But I was thinking,” I continued. “That we could take the trip in stages. Stop in Hawaii for a few days so I could adjust.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Hawaii!” my sister crowed. “Give me that laptop! Here, book it now! You’re going to have the time of your life!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We didn’t book the trip right away, but my sister’s enthusiasm was contagious. So what if 24 hours on a plane made my health crash? I could take a few days to lie in bed and recuperate, and when I was all together again, I’d be in New Zealand. In the summertime. It was the idea of skipping a month of winter that sold it to us in the end. Not having to live through January in New York State sounded like a miracle. We decided that we wouldn’t attempt any side trips to Australia. We’d just fly in to Auckland at the end of December, fly out of Auckland three weeks later, and in between, take things easy and see as much of New Zealand as my health would permit. And on the way, we’d spend Christmas Day in Hawaii to break up the flight.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This plan sounded very realistic and do-able. I liked that it wasn’t a high-pressure situation, where I had to perform, or I was destroying everything. My girlfriend had been to New Zealand before, so she didn’t have her heart set on seeing every inch of the place. It was all right if we took things slowly.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Before we did the final booking of the flights, I found us a place to stay in Auckland that was very reasonably priced. It was a little apartment that had a kitchenette, living room and even a laundry machine right there in the apartment. It sounded like an ideal place to spend four or five days holing up and getting myself together after the long flight. Then I sat my girlfriend down to ask her the most important question of all.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What’s the food like in New Zealand?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Just regular food,” she said. “Like here.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was worried about the gluten free angle. Traveling meant eating out every day. Would I be able to find cuisines that I knew were safe?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Did you notice a lot of Indian restaurants when you were there?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Most of the menu in every Indian restaurant was naturally gluten free.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well, I guess,” she said. “In the cities. But a lot of towns were really small. One day I got stuck in this tiny place on Easter Sunday and literally nothing was open. I was starving. And then I found this gas station. Oh wow, it was great. They have surprisingly good food in gas stations in New Zealand, great little pies.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Pies were not going to help my situation.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” I said. “Then maybe we could stick to the big cities.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend shook her head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s not really how it works,” she said. “I mean, all the cool stuff is kind of remote. The glacier, the fjords, the volcanic springs, they’re not exactly in the middle of Auckland, you know?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know,” I frowned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But really, don’t worry,” she said. “It’s very easy to get around. The whole country is set up for tourists. It’ll be no problem to figure this stuff out once we get there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went back to my computer and brought up Auckland on Google Maps. I zoomed in and looked up and down the street that our hotel was on. I spotted a restaurant called Satya Indian Cuisine, clicked on their website, and sent them an email, asking if there were going to be open over the Christmas break. They replied, saying that they were, so I relaxed a little. I knew where I was going to be sleeping and what I was going to be eating for the first few days. It calmed me down enough to be able to go ahead and book the flights. I had six weeks to figure the rest of it out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As soon as the flights were booked, something went wrong with my heart. Whenever I sat down, I could feel the thick, heavy sensation of blood pooling in my legs. It was as if the battery on my heart muscle was running low, and it couldn’t pump the blood around my body at the normal speed. My hands were ghostly white and freezing and I began to have episodes where my teeth chattered and my body was wracked with shivers even if the room was toasty warm.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One of these episodes hit me right before our guests began to arrive for a party. A couple of weeks back, I had put out word that we were hosting a board game night for all the local lesbians. It had seemed like a great idea at the time. Kind of like the great idea of booking a month-long trip to the other side of the world with a dodgy heart. Some of the people who were coming were women I’d never met before. I’d hoped that our friendly invitation and warm welcome would impress them, but here I was, sitting forlornly on the couch, my teeth chattering and my arms jumping with shivers.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Give me your feet,” my girlfriend instructed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She placed big red fluffy slippers on them.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Now lie down,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I lay on the couch, and she proceeded to roll me up in a comforter, and then top me off with three more blankets.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Better?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded, and just then the doorbell rang.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But I don’t think I can get the door,” I laughed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Stay right there,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two couples came in who I’d never met before. They introduced themselves to my girlfriend at the door, and then came into the living room and I extracted an arm from under all the blankets so that I could shake their hands.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Are you all wrapped up because you’re cold?” one of them asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The long answer to that question flashed through my head. <span class="italic">I’ve been chelating for a year and a half with Alpha Lipoic Acid, which you probably know as a heart antioxidant. I stopped taking it three weeks ago, and now my heart seems to have lost its ability to pump the blood around my body at the normal speed. The slow-moving blood isn’t keeping me warm. I sincerely hope that this effect will pass before I have to take a flight to the other side of the world.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But I kept it brief. I said, “Yup, I’m freezing.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The evening went on, and I even shed the blankets during a lively game of Pictionary. But the whole episode made me doubt everything. Was it time to go back on ALA? Much to my relief, over the next few days, my heart slowly returned to normal and I decided I was okay.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then it was my liver’s turn. December seemed to be all about packages arriving in the mail. I had to make sure that I brought along a month’s supply of each of my supplements on my trip. I also had to find a bottle of the only kind of sunblock I wasn’t allergic to, which was devilishly hard to do in the middle of December. Then I’d ordered a clever product I’d found online, a little baggie made of silicone that was exactly the size of a slice of toast. When I went to New Zealand, I could bring along a loaf of gluten free bread, pop a slice in this baggie, and pop it in any toaster without fearing it would get contaminated with lingering gluten crumbs.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On top of all that, there were eight Hanukkah presents to buy, one for each night. The one I was most excited about was a pair of electronic dance mats for our exercise Playstation game Dance Dance Revolution. We had played it all the time before I got sick, and now that I was able to exercise a little again, I’d ordered the deluxe, padded version of the dance mats to optimize our game playing experience.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The dance mats arrived ready to assemble the same day that a surprise package arrived from my sister. It was a shiny new toaster. It made me laugh because she had teased us so much about our beat-up old toaster when she visited in the fall.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I called her up to thank her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We’re not throwing the old one away,” I laughed. “We’re going to keep it for gluten toast. Gluten won’t be banished to the oven anymore. And the new one will be all mine, gluten free!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Since my girlfriend wasn’t home, I went down to the basement to assemble the dance mats. There were pieces of stiff foam that needed to be fit together like puzzle pieces and then zipped up inside the dance mats. The foam had a strong chemical smell, and I washed my hands thoroughly when I was done, but the damage was already done.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Hey, a new toaster!” my girlfriend exclaimed when she got home.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Stupid toaster,” I said. “We don’t need a new one.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt nauseous, headachy, and very cranky. I’d felt like this back during the dump phase, whenever I’d gone into stores that had a lot of products that smelled like chemicals. The dollar store where we’d lived before had been particularly bad. Our home was usually free of chemical crap, but now that it had invaded my space, I’d been instantly wiped out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">A wave of despair washed over me and tears began to leak out of my eyes. If I couldn’t deal with opening a couple of simple holiday gifts, how was I supposed to travel? I’d set up my life in a gluten-free chemical-free bubble. How was I supposed to function in the real world? I was kidding myself if I thought that I was well. I was still sick as dog.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The despair died down over the next day or so, and was followed by a vicious bout of constipation, which was a sure sign that my liver was struggling. It made sense. ALA was as much an antioxidant for the liver as it was for the heart.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Trying out the new toaster brought on another liver episode, and that was followed by another when I presented the dance mats to my girlfriend on the first night of Hanukkah and we tried them out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next morning, my girlfriend found me dragging the mats out to the garage.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m not going to have them in this house!” I said in an angry fit of tears. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“But you just gave them to me,” my girlfriend said. “When can I have them back?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Never!” I said. “I’m going to go online and sell them!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My hip went out the next day when I bent down to tie my shoe. This hadn’t happened to me in more than six months, not since we’d moved to Beacon. I’d been sure that chelation had cleared this up permanently. I sat down and rested for a few minutes, still feeling the pain even as I sat. The pain went on and on, and I was afraid to stand in case I made things much worse. I was stranded in a chair that was far away from the TV or a bookshelf. I had nothing to do except think.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">What was I going to do now? We were due to leave on our trip in a week. I hadn’t needed the services of a chiropractor since we’d moved to our new home. Did it make more sense to drive for an hour to the guy by our old home, or try to find a new one here? The old guy had been good, but when my right hip was out, driving was very hard, lifting my foot from the gas to the brake hurt like hell. Maybe my girlfriend would drive me there.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">While I thought, I idly examined my nails, and was surprised to find them all dotted with white horizontal lines. The Mee’s Lines were back, the classic badge of heavy metal toxicity that I’d unknowingly worn throughout childhood.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The words of my old chiropractor suddenly echoed through my head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Pour enough antioxidants down someone’s throat, and they’re sure to feel fine for a while. But what happens when you stop?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Well here I was, going cold turkey on the antioxidants, and it looked like every one of my mercury symptoms was popping up to make a reappearance. What did it mean? Had ALA just been a trick, a coat of paint thrown onto a moldy wall? Now that it was wearing away, was the nastiness that had been there all along beginning to show through?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My hip pain faded without the help of a chiropractor, and I vacillated back and forth, thinking one day that the smartest thing to do would be to take some stupid ALA, deciding the next that I didn’t need to, that all of the symptoms I was experiencing were passing temporary blips.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then it was two days before my trip, and I was sitting in a coffee shop, having a last cup of peppermint tea with my friend Kelly.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was complaining bitterly about the exhaustive preparations I’d had to make for a trip I’d lost all enthusiasm for.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And I bought a little baggie for my gluten free bread that can go in toasters. But after the first week when I eat up the loaf of bread I bring, I don’t know what I’m going to eat. I haven’t been feeling great, so I didn’t have enough time to do all the research I wanted to. I didn’t even get to look up if they have gluten free bread in New Zealand. Or if they even let you bring bread through customs.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Kelly’s brow was creased.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Let’s back up,” she said. “To the plastic bag you’re going to put in a toaster?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s not plastic,” I said. “It’s silicone, and the heat goes through it, but it protects the bread from contamination by gluten crumbs left in the toaster.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I see what you mean,” she said. “You bought a toast condom.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well, yes,” I said. “I guess I did.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And you’re dreading spending a month in Hawaii and New Zealand because there’s a possibility you might get sick.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I know I sound like a real whiner,” I said. “But you didn’t know me when I was really sick. The six months I’ve been living here, it’s the first time I’ve ever felt properly healthy. I’m afraid I’ll lose that if I leave. What if it only works here?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Health isn’t something that exists in a place,” Kelly said. “It goes wherever you go. It’s in your body.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I guess,” I said. “But I feel like I‘m standing in line for one of those crazy big rollercoasters at Six Flags. Everyone around me is saying how much fun it‘s going to be, but I’m afraid it’s just going to make me throw up.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well, I’d be happy to help,” Kelly said. “I can go ahead and take your place on the trip, and you can stay here and shovel the snow and feed my cats.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I began to smile, and then to laugh.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m going to have a good time?” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s why you’re going,” Kelly said. “Right?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My final day of packing and preparation was marred by pretty dramatic PMS. Folding my shorts and t-shirts and packing them in my bag, tears kept leaking from my eyes. But when it got to the point when we finally left the house, it was as if a great weight was taken from my shoulders. I didn’t have to prepare anymore. I didn’t have to keep guessing what was going to happen, preparing for every possible outcome. I just had to do it, live through it, and enjoy it if I could.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Five days later, I was putting my laundry in the washing machine in the little apartment I’d found online in Auckland. The night before, we’d eaten our dinner at the Indian restaurant I’d found on Google maps, and just a few hours ago, we’d eaten our lunch at a nearby burger joint that had a full gluten free menu. Then we’d stopped in the bookstore to buy the <span class="italic">Rough Guide to New Zealand</span>. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I picked it up now, and studied the maps and lists of attractions. This was something I hadn’t had a single spare moment to do during all of my extensive preparations. Turning to the section on the north island, I learned that just a couple hours away, there was a place where you could take a boat trip through a cave filled with glowworms. Not far from there in Rotorua, there were baths build around volcanic hot springs, and state parks that were filled with bubbling mud pools and alien yellow and green sulfuric formations.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We were slated to spend another three days in Auckland so that I could recover, but I was beginning to wonder what exactly I needed to recover from. The flight to Hawaii had been uneventful. The hotel there, the 80 degree heat, and Christmas Day on the beach had been glorious. Then the dreaded overnight flight to Auckland had been fine. I’d even slept for a few hours by taking a sleeping pill, one that I’d practiced taking at home to make sure I wouldn’t have a bad reaction to it. Our first day in Auckland, I’d been out of sorts and cranky, but now I was raring to go.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Let’s check out early,” I said to my girlfriend. “And go see the glowworms tomorrow. Then head to Rotorua.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Are you sure?” she asked. “You’re okay?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Perfect,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I found an internet café and looked up gluten free dining options in Rotorua. There were much better than your average American town of that size. Besides an Indian restaurant, there was a branch of the burger joint with the gluten free menu, and also a branch of a pizza place with a full gluten free menu. It looked like this was going to be pretty easy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We went to the tourist office to book our travel and accommodation. We booked three nights in Rotorua.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What happens after that?” I asked my girlfriend.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We’ll just move on to the next place the looks good,” my girlfriend said. “We don’t have to plan it all right now.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And so we played it by ear, booking buses, flights, tours, ferries as we went. We stayed in accommodations that had kitchenettes when we could, and I had plenty of opportunities to use the toast condom. When the loaf of bread I brought along ran out, I bought more gluten free bread in the supermarket across the road from our B&amp;B. Their gluten free selection was far better than that of most American supermarkets.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We saw the glowworms in their cave, a luminous green constellation hanging eerily from above. We saw the steam rise off the pools of water heated by the lava just under the surface of the earth. We took nature tours, saw kiwi fruit growing on the vine, and kiwi birds in the darkened houses where they were raised before being released into the wild. We took a boat out into a craggy fjord, so tall that waterfalls that began at the top disappeared into mist before they reached the bottom.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And I walked. I hiked. I dragged my luggage around with me for three weeks. I got up every day and went out and saw everything and did everything. And then I got up and did it all again the next day. I even climbed a mountain. It wasn’t much of a mountain by Kiwi standards, but sitting at the top of it, eating an apple while my girlfriend took pictures of me and the incredible scenery, I felt like I’d climbed to the top of the world.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I wasn’t the same person that I’d been six months or a year before. A profound change had taken place inside me. I felt clarity, peace, resilience, strength. And under it all, there was a bedrock of knowing, a sureness that I could rely on this. My body was no longer struggling, crushed under an unbearable burden. The mercury was gone, I had finally entered a space of true healing.</span></span></span></p>
