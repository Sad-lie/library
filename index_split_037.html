<p class="calibre_2">In years to come I shall wince at the remembrance of how much time, assistance, and recollective effort I demanded from my sources for this book, and how little—this little book, in fact—I have been able to give them in return. I am grateful to all of them (those I’m permitted to mention are listed on the next three pages), but I want to acknowledge a special debt to Skip Atwater, Hal Puthoff, Mel and Edith Riley, and General Ed Thompson, who were heroically cooperative.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I also want to thank my editors, Stephanie Gunning and Mike Shohl at Dell; fellow researchers Bill LaParl and Marcello Truzzi; Gerri Harcarik at the U.S. Army’s Center for Military History; Wendy Sparks at the Ronald Reagan Library; the staff of the cartographic branch and the still photo branch of the National Archives; Joe Haytas at the Defense Visual Information Center; William Pearce at the INSCOM Freedom of Information Act Office; and Virginia Grenier of the Fort Bragg FOIA office.</p>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_70"></div>
