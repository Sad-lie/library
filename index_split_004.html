<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The week after I had my last amalgam removed, I decided to stop eating gluten for a while. After what the dentist had said about food allergies, I wanted to check and see if I had celiac disease like her. I wasn’t 100% sure which packaged foods had gluten in them. Most ingredient lists didn’t specify. So I just steered my choices towards the foods I usually ate that were naturally gluten free: millet, potatoes, sprouted grains, fruits and vegetables, peas and beans.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t notice anything dramatic for the first few days. I didn’t really think much about it until the fourth day, when I woke up feeling poorly. I had a headache and was in a bad mood. This was a kind of headache I often got. I hated it. It wasn’t very painful, but no matter what I did, it was always there in the background, going on and on for hours. I’d never thought very hard about the cause of it before. But today, I wondered, could it possibly be gluten? Had I eaten some accidentally?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went out into the kitchen and mentally retraced my eating steps from the day before.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Breakfast: millet, plain yoghurt, raisins, cinnamon. I pulled out the packages and looked. All of them were single ingredient foods. All clean.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Lunch: an avocado on Ezekiel sprouted bread. The avocado was obviously fine, but what about the bread? I took the loaf out the freezer and examined the ingredients list. The first ingredient on the list was Organic Sprouted Wheat. I’d picked up the little tidbit of information somewhere that if a grain was sprouted, it became gluten free, but was that actually true? Was this bread really gluten free?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went online and quickly found out that I had unwittingly ingested gluten by eating this bread. I also learned that even if the bread had been gluten free, there was a good chance it had picked up some lingering gluten crumbs while sitting in the toaster.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Eureka.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I got my gluten free diet back on track, and my head felt clear and my mood sunny in the days that followed. It was a revelation. I decided I wouldn’t make any more mistakes, and started educating myself by reading lists of safe foods and following the discussion boards at celiac.com.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Before my girlfriend and I went to the health food supermarket for our next weekly shopping trip, I purged the kitchen of glutenous foods that I knew that neither of us would ever eat. The energy bars sweetened with barley malt, the breaded fish sticks and chicken nuggets that my vegetarian girlfriend wouldn’t touch. They filled up the garbage can, and I looked at them sadly. There was no going back. Celiac disease was a lifetime condition that couldn’t be reversed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Goodbye forever,” I said and closed the garbage can.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend put her arm around me as I started to cry.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re being very brave,” she said. “You’re a good girl.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Later, walking home from the store, I perked up considerably. I had given myself permission to buy six different kinds of gluten free cookies. My health mystery was solved. Gluten was the real culprit, not sugar. So I was reaching into my shopping bag and having a little sugar party to celebrate.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“These lemon wafers are pretty good,” I said, offering a bite to my girlfriend.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Definitely edible,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Uck, but these chocolate chip ones are terrible,” I said. “Want to try?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“When you put it like that,” she said. “No thanks.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As the days and weeks passed, I felt better and better. My head was clear, my digestion was good, my mood was great, I had buckets of physical and emotional stamina. It was clear that gluten had somehow been at the root of all my health problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Researching more, I read that people on the gluten free diet often ended up low on B vitamins because gluten grains were the main source of them in the human diet. I supplemented with a B complex for a couple of weeks, but the supplement caused a terrible stiffness and pain to build up in the left side of my neck. I stopped taking it and it went away. I decided to stop taking all of my other supplements too. Why was I taking them? I was healthy now. All I needed was the gluten free diet, and I would be perfectly healthy forever.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two months into the gluten free diet, I was healthier than I’d ever been. I was able to eat anything I wanted, as long as it was gluten free. I ate dessert daily, doing my best to make up for those two years I went without sugar. Hypoglycemia was a thing of the past. And best of all, my mood was calm and even. My girlfriend remarked on it to all our friends.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How did you do it?” they asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I went to the dentist to get my fillings out,” I always began. I liked to fool around and imply that it was some kind of mercury filling removal miracle story. But I always explained what really happened.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“My dentist has celiac disease,” I said. “And when I said I had food allergies, she told me to try the gluten free diet. And I did. And I found out I’m totally allergic!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It didn’t occur to me for one second that mercury had anything to do with it. It didn’t even cross my mind that there was a connection between amalgam removal and my disappearing symptoms. When I ate gluten free, I felt great. If I ate some gluten accidentally, I felt terrible. Case closed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t feel that I really needed to, but since it had been the point of this whole exercise of getting my amalgams out, I went ahead and planned my first Hulda Clark liver flush. I took a booster dose of the parasite killer the night before I began. It had never done anything for me before except make me tired. But this dose was recommended in the liver flush instructions, so I dutifully took it. And right before my first liver flush began, I surprised myself greatly by pooping out an 8 inch long tapeworm. I knew that it was impossible to pass a live worm, but it was still an alarming sight.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">Wow! </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2">I thought. <span class="italic">Wow! This thing was living inside me! Holy shit!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I grabbed the cordless phone, brought it into the bathroom and called Margaret.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s not flat looking,” I said, poking at it with a chopstick in the toilet bowl. “Are you sure it’s a tapeworm?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Does it basically look like a very long earthworm?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yup,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well that’s what certain kinds of tapeworms look like,” she said. “Google ‘images of fish tapeworms’ and you’ll see. Anyway, congratulations on your successful cleanse!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The long-awaited liver flush happened the next day. The instructions on the Hulda Clark website said that I should expect to feel nauseous. This made me a little nervous. How bad was this going to be? At the same time, I was excited. This Hulda Clark stuff really worked. Even if the cleanse was a bit rough, the results would be worth it. All the gunk in my liver was going to get cleaned out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I followed the instructions in Hulda Clark’s book and fasted after lunch and then began to drink doses of Epsom salts dissolved in water. The Epsom salts solution tasted absolutely terrible, it was very hard to get it down. By the time I had to take my second dose, I was feeling quite queasy. Was this really worth it? Right before bed, I downed the drink that would make my liver expel stones: half a cup of olive oil mixed with half a cup of grapefruit juice. It didn’t taste anywhere near as bad as the Epsom salts.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I fell asleep, woke up briefly during the night feeling nauseated, and the next morning, woke up and started pooping stones. Some were pink and rubbery, like the ones I’d seen during previous parasite cleanses. Some were pea green, but most of them were tan. I peered at them as they floated in the toilet bowl. Here they were, the famous liver stones that I’d read so much about. Left inside they body, they congested the liver and filled up the gall bladder. When they got infected, people needed gall bladder surgery. I was proud that I had gotten them out. It was just a few dozen stones, some of them just an eighth of an inch in diameter, others up to half an inch.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Hulda Clark said that one liver flush would improve health temporarily, but multiple flushes were necessary for permanent change. Passing a total of two thousand stones was apparently the benchmark. I wrote down 87 in my notebook, and wondered what kind of temporary improvements I’d notice.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Eating at home on the gluten free diet was a breeze. It was only eating out that presented a challenge, but since we lived in New York City, it really wasn’t that much of a big deal. It wasn’t very difficult to go online and scope out safe places to eat in most neighborhoods. They didn’t like to make a big deal about it—probably because ‘gluten free’ sounded too much like ‘health food’—but lots of restaurants had separate gluten free menus if you asked. Their kitchen staff had been trained to avoid accidental contamination of food with gluten, and you could rest assured that they weren’t cutting up your rice crust pizza on the same cutting board they used for the wheat ones.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But we weren’t going to be in New York City for long. My girlfriend and I were finally taking the plunge and moving out of the city. We were going to be living in a very rural area near where my girlfriend’s father lived. Its remoteness was offset somewhat by the fact that the train to New York City was a two-minute walk from our house. My girlfriend was going to keep her job and commute into the city, but I quit my job as a nanny and was looking for a new one upstate.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was a big transition, so to help me out while I found my feet in my new community, I decided to go back to see my old therapist for a while. She had been very helpful when I’d first moved to New York City, helping me sort out my feelings about my dysfunctional family back in Ireland, and giving me permission to discover my true voice and creativity. I’d stopped seeing her for a couple of years because I felt that I got more out of working on my physical rather than my emotional health. But this was a good time to rekindle a connection with someone who knew me so thoroughly.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At our first session back, there was a lot of catch-up. We finally made it up to recent events: having a real house with a real garden where we could grow our own vegetables, how great getting on the gluten free diet had been, and the successful liver cleanse. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I mean, it would have been better if I’d gotten out hundreds of stones,” I said. “My ultimate goal is two thousand. But I was pretty happy.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Her brow creased.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t understand,” she said. “All of these stones. Don’t they overflow the toilet bowl?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I smiled and remembered who I was talking to. This was the woman I’d caught sneaking a cigarette out on the sidewalk before one of our sessions, someone who hadn’t understood what I meant when I said I was trying a ‘high fiber diet.’ I backed up and explained some more. For good measure, I threw in a graphic description of my friend the tapeworm.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oy vey is mir,” she said. “It must make such a difference not to have a worm inside you anymore.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I smiled and nodded, but the reality was that I wasn’t really feeling much better. The truth was that I’d begun to feel a little bit worse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had been to a Passover Seder the week before and had been delighted to see that our host had baked a flourless chocolate cake. This was an intensely rich and yummy gluten free treat, and I had eaten practically half of it all by myself.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next day, I was very disappointed to find that my digestive system could not handle that much chocolate. My hemorrhoid, which had been dormant since amalgam removal, began to bleed again. I had thought that being on the gluten free diet meant that I was on the road to perfect health, but it wasn’t the case.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I continued with the liver cleanses throughout the spring. During the second one, I got 400 stones out, and during the third, I got 250 out. I was making good progress towards getting two thousand stones out, but the promised improvements were not materializing. In fact, my digestion seemed to be deteriorating.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The flourless chocolate cake was just the start of it. I had gone to one of the very few local restaurants in our new country village, and ordered the only gluten free dish on the menu: steak. I wasn’t a big red meat eater. My girlfriend was vegetarian, so I had never learned how to cook it. The day after, my hemorrhoid bled and bled. I had already given up chocolate after the Seder. Now I gave up red meat too. I mentally crossed that restaurant off my very short list of dining options.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I restricted my diet more, easing up on my sugar consumption and focusing on healthy whole foods, but my energy and enthusiasm for life waned. I became fretful, and could burst into tears at the drop of a hat. I thought it was related to having moved house. It made sense. The initial excitement of moving was over, now I just faced the drudgery of getting the house and garden in order, and the twin daunting tasks of coming up with new friends and a new job. It was understandable that I missed my old life in the city.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">To cheer myself up, the next time I went into the city for therapy, instead of just loading up on gluten free staples at upstairs Fairway and going home, I arranged to meet up with my girlfriend for lunch. I’d read online that a Chinese restaurant called Gourmetland had announced the launch of its new gluten free menu. We were going to go check it out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When we got there, we saw that we were the only customers in the place. The waiter took his time, happy to guide me through my gluten free options, and even told me about some gluten free specials that weren’t on the menu. I was happy to hear that I could order gluten free fried rice. It was one of my favorite dishes and I hadn’t had it since I’d gone gluten free.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Our dishes were brought to the table and we started to eat. After a minute, we noticed the white-coated chef emerging from the kitchen, beckoning to our waiter, and engaging him in an intense discussion in the corner. Every now and then, he gestured towards our table. We couldn’t understand a word of their exchange, but it was obvious that we were the topic of their heated discussion.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Eventually, the red-faced waiter approached our table.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m very very sorry,” he said, removing my dish of fried rice. “But we made a mistake. There are two versions of our fried rice, and the chef made the one that is not gluten free. He’ll make you another one right away.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My girlfriend and I looked at each other, appalled. I felt the contaminated food clench like a rock in my stomach.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, thank you,” I said. “I don’t want any more.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’ll make sure it’s gluten free,” the waiter said. “I’m so sorry.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m done,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Me too,” said my girlfriend, and the hand-wringing waiter apologized to us all the way out the door.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Nothing happened that evening. I made my way home and ate my dinner, feeling fine. But I knew that this was my pattern. In the early days when I still made mistakes and gotten glutened, I never felt bad right away, it always started the next morning. This time it began in the middle of the night.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I woke up to find that my left arm had gone numb, as if I’d been lying on it and it had lost circulation. I rolled over in an attempt to free it up, but realized that it had been free all along. It had gone numb for no reason.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In the morning it was my feet that lost sensation. They went through cycles of numbness and tingling. And then my mouth and my scalp joined in on the action. This was all in addition to an intense version of my usual gluten headache, which had come with the extra twist of an odd kind of tunnel vision. Everything looked a shade darker than usual, with shadows around the periphery. All in all, it was a miserable day, because of the symptoms I was suffering through, and also because of what they signified.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was a slap in the face. I wasn’t as supremely healthy as I’d thought. I had blithely been going along, thinking that I would feel better and better as long as I stuck to the gluten free diet. After the first few weeks, I’d even stopped reading the discussion forums on celiac.com, thinking I had it all figured out. But it was obvious now that I needed to do some research. I was just four months into this thing, and clouds had already gathered on the horizon. I needed to know what they meant.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went online and studied the celiac forums. I read some posts written by people who had the numbness and tingling I was experiencing. Apparently the medical term for it was ‘neuropathy’ and some people with celiac disease had neuropathy as their main symptom instead of the more common diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">One woman said:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">“The numbness is getting worse. My doctor says there is nothing he can give me for it. The only treatment is to stay strictly on the gluten free diet. I am doing my best, and hope and pray that this will stop it from progressing.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This sounded serious. Most people on the forums talked about how their gluten symptoms got a lot more frightening the longer they stayed on the gluten free diet. Suddenly, I was scared. It looked like there was no margin for error.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then, out of the blue, I got a yeast infection. I didn’t know what it was, because I’d never had one before, but my girlfriend explained that this was what my vaginal itching and discomfort was. She told me that a very effective natural remedy was to take a clove of garlic, nick it with a knife, and use it as a vaginal suppository. I tried this, and it worked. For a little while.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The yeast infection came back the next week, and along with it came the incredible and overwhelming certainty that I was Doomed. I could do nothing except sob hysterically until the feeling passed. It didn’t go away entirely. I walked around from then on feeling that I was a little bit doomed, but I was able to not actively wail about it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I brought this symptom and emotional reaction in to my therapist at my next session. I almost felt embarrassed at how obvious this was, what an easy pitch I was lobbing into her lap. These were the kinds of sessions therapists waited for, right?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What do you think your body is trying to tell you?” she asked gently.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I shook my head mutely.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How do you feel?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Like I’m drowning in horror,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Is there a part of you that holds a memory?” she said. “An event in the past connected with that horror?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I tried. I searched inside myself, but there was no other part of me holding anything. Just me alone, trapped in a pit of physical and emotional misery.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Talk therapy was not going to fix this. Well, if the problem was not psychological, then it clearly had to be physical. I saw now that I had been playing around with cleansing, doing a little parasite cleanse here, a little liver flushing there. It was clear to me now that I had to get serious with the cleansing. It was time for the big guns.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took out a video that Margaret had lent me. It was an interview with the natural healer Dr. Richard Schulze. He was famous for his ‘Incurables Program,’ and in the video, he listed all the cleanses that made up the complete program. He talked about how powerful it was to cleanse the liver, kidneys, lungs, all systems of the body at once. But he emphasized that none of it would have any effect if the most important cleanse was omitted.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This of course was the bowel cleanse. If the bowel was congested with gunk, if it was backed up and leaking toxins into the bloodstream, none of the other cleanses would make the slightest difference. In fact, they would probably make things worse. The bowel was the channel through which toxins exited the body, and it had to be clear before any healing could happen.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I saw now that I had been doing everything backwards. I should have done the bowel cleanse first. A congested bowel was clearly the root of all my problems. Diseased conditions in my bowel had brought on an overgrowth of candida, and caused those crazy yeast infections. An inflamed bowel had caused my hemorrhoid to flare up, and had made my reaction to gluten frighteningly intense. Maybe it had even caused my whole case of gluten intolerance.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Well, I was going to get started right away and fix this whole mess. I was going to cleanse my bowel until all my ills were cured.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went online, ordered the tinctures and powders I needed, and over the next two months, mixed up and choked back a special bowel cleansing drink three times a day. It was jet black in color because it contained powdered charcoal, which was excellent at absorbing toxins from the intestines. But that wasn’t all it contained. There were six other ingredients, each with its own healing and cleansing properties, from apple pectin powder which would sweep the gunk out of my intestines, to slippery elm which would soothe and heal my inner tissues.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On top of all this, I was also running a simultaneous parasite cleanse because I knew for sure I had parasites, and was on a sugar-free-whole-food-anti-candida diet which I sometimes interspersed with periods of juicing and raw food fasts. I was doing healing enemas twice a week, and was also taking milk thistle every day, just in case my problems were due to congestion in my liver. It was a pretty hard core healing regimen, a kind of lite version of the incurables program. It wasn’t a million miles from the cleanse Margaret had used to cure her cancer.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The result?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt worse. Much much worse. Physically, I had started to have unexplained episodes of weakness and stomach pain at 11am every morning. If I ate foods that contained a lot of potassium like potatoes or bananas, I felt lightheaded, like I might pass out. Despite the fact that I was on a healing bowel cleanse and took frequent enemas, my hemorrhoid bled regularly. My physical strength and stamina were ebbing away. I was spending more and more days resting in bed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And how was I doing mentally? Frankly, I was turning into a basket case. I was moody and irritable much of the time. When my girlfriend was around, I couldn’t help picking on her and starting stupid fights. When she wasn’t, I resented being left alone. After a few short weeks of reprieve during the first phase of the parasite cleanse, the hysterical yeast infections returned. It seemed that every day, I was fighting some kind of inner demon. One night, I developed an irrational fear of the light and shadow playing against my bedroom wall. It was just headlights from the parking lot across the street, casting strange shadows through the trees and brush, but my mind interpreted it as a mysterious and sinister invasion of my space. I stood outside my bedroom window in the dark, trying to catch whatever it was, but it got away.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I lay in bed for hours, staring at the ceiling, wondering what could be chewing up my insides. It had to be something huge. Only a seriously scary disease could stand up against all of the cleansing firepower I was throwing at it. When pain lingered on the left side of my body, I imagined that I had a tumor in my pancreas. Those were very aggressive. I’d probably be dead in a month. On days when my thoughts and emotions were particularly haywire, I pictured a tumor eating up my brain. The worst of it was that I was completely aware of how nutty I was. A part of me could tell very clearly that I was losing it. But nothing I told myself, nothing I did, nothing I ate or didn’t eat, nothing I took could make it stop.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I knew that I was out of my depth, so I reached out to my girlfriend, trying to explain to her that there was something wrong.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I have a weird feeling that I might be dying,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean?” she asked. “Dying of what?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Is there something wrong? Do you feel sick?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well, I had those yeast infections,” I said. “And I…”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t put it into words that made sense. What could I say? I have a terrifying incurable disease that might just be moodiness?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“…I don’t feel right,” I finished lamely.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Did you maybe eat some gluten?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">No I didn’t, </span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2">I thought. But I didn’t have enough energy to contradict her. Not enough to open my mouth and also keep the tears at bay. Wasn’t I saying it right? Couldn’t she hear that I was asking for help?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’ve been doing great,” she said. “This is just a temporary setback. You’ll figure it out. You always do.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded and left the room. I could understand why she wasn’t interested. I always had some kind of health project going on. Why should she get drawn into this one? Her message was clear. Go away and figure this out on your own.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On a day when the yeast was up and active, I was sitting in my therapist’s office, trying to explain to her what was happening to me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I feel like I’m decomposing,” I said. “It’s inside me. In my gut. It’s eating me from the inside out.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I see,” she said. “And on what other level can we ask the question, <span class="italic">What’s inside my gut?”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No other level!” I exploded. “This is physical! This is happening to me today! This is not a memory!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt like I was dying by inches in front of everybody’s eyes, and nobody saw or cared. And yet, if I was really dying, why wasn’t it obvious what I was dying of? What were my terrible symptoms? Why wasn’t I rushing to a doctor for help? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Ha! Because I could imagine how that conversation would go.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I have a number of problems that all have been increasing in severity in the past few months. I wonder if there’s some underlying connection between them all.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay, well, what are your problems?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Constipation—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Here’s a laxative.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Hemorrhoids—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Here are some suppositories.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeast infections—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Here’s some Monistat.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And a growing sense of Doom.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Would you like Prozac or Paxil for that?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Why pay $200 to have that idiotic conversation. There was no point in going to a doctor until I knew what was wrong with me, and despite all of my efforts, I still didn’t know.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Fall was approaching. It was now nine months since I’d had my last amalgam filling removed, and five months since the beginning of my mysterious spiral into ill health. I’d done some work on the garden, planted and harvested, even done some canning, but I’d made no real progress in my job search. I was spending far too much time at home alone, brooding over my health. The story I told myself and others was that I was working on editing my novel. But most of my time in front of the computer was spent searching the internet, trying to find out what the hell was wrong with me. I had moved well past WebMD at this point. Mainstream medicine did not have the answers. I trawled every natural healing website I could find, plugged my symptoms into google in every combination I could think of, but only came up with the same tired advice: <span class="italic">If you have digestive problems, try the gluten free diet, try a bowel cleanse, try a liver flush. If you have chronic yeast infections, try having your amalgam fillings removed because mercury toxicity can exacerbate yeast.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Well my amalgam fillings had been removed long before my yeast got exacerbated. Mercury was the only thing I could definitely cross off my list of suspects. It had left the building months ago. I tried more google searches, but kept coming up with the same frustrating answers. It was all totally useless.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I needed to get out of the house. But I had come to a point where I was pretty sure I couldn’t hold down a real job. My thoughts were often clouded with irrational fear. Was I even capable of having normal interactions with normal people? I’d spent so much of the summer alone, I didn’t even know. I decided to ease gently back into the workforce.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There was a school for emotionally disturbed kids halfway between the city and our house. They were looking for volunteers to help run their campus farm program. I made an appointment for an interview with the farm director.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Even though I had use of the car every day, I was glad to see that I could take the train and then a local bus to the school. I had become more and more anxious whenever I had to drive. It was as if my brain took too long to comprehend what was coming up in the road in front of me. I had far too many moments looking out the windshield, wondering, What am I looking at? Is that gray thing the road? Or is it a wall? When is the answer going to come to me? Please tell me that I’m not supposed to guess?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">As a result, I drove like a scared old lady, which infuriated the drivers behind me on our country two-lane roads, and made me hate driving even more. I only took the car out when I had no other option.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The farm director was very happy to give me the tour of the facilities. It was very impressive. There was a horse riding program, domestic animals like pigs, goats and sheep, as well as exotic creatures like llamas, emus, and birds of prey. As we walked, he asked me about myself, and I fed him the line I’d rehearsed about being a writer working from home who wanted to get out of the house and do some physical work.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I used to work as a nanny when I lived in the city,” I said. “I did that part time, and then wrote the rest of the time.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s great,” he said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We paused and leaned on a fence, watching an intern shoveling horse manure into a wheelbarrow.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m afraid it’s not very glamorous work,” he said. “A lot of shoveling, a lot of cleaning out stalls. But I’m sure we can work in some time where you can assist with classes and have more interaction with the children.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded and smiled, but secretly planned to avoid any situation where I was expected to act like a real grown-up. I was scared that I wouldn’t be able to perform, that my brain would spaz out, and I’d be unmasked as being just as emotionally disturbed as the kids I was supposed to take care of.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And so one day a week, I got on the train and took the bus to the school and worked like a dog doing the most menial chores I could find. It was work that drained my already-depleted energy stores, but I was glad to do it because it made me feel somewhat like a productive member of society. Once every other week, I got on the train and went into the city to see my therapist. And the rest of the time, I spent at home, tinkering with my cleanses, trying very hard not to fight with my girlfriend when she was around, and trying very hard to solve my health mystery when she was not.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In my recent reading on the internet, everything seemed to circle back to mercury. Everywhere I looked, the answer was mercury. It was so frustrating. How could mercury possibly be the culprit in my case? The last trace of amalgam had been removed from my mouth nine months before. Mercury hadn’t made me particularly sick during amalgam removal, a time when my exposure to it was at its highest. Why would it make me sick now, when the last traces of it should be fading away?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But with all the talk online about the connection between yeast infections and mercury, I was forced to open my mind to the idea.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">For mercury to make me sick now, there would have to be some problem with the way my body was getting rid of it. How did the human body excrete mercury anyway?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I looked it up, and found that mercury came out through sweat, urine, and was also exported from the liver via bile, and traveled through the colon to be excreted as feces. I could feel that something was wrong with my digestive system. Was mercury doing it? Was that because the mercury was coming out too fast? Or maybe it was coming out too slow? Was it building up in my gut and causing problems? Should I quit the bowel cleanse to slow things down? Or redouble my efforts to speed things up? I truly had no idea.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I decided to hedge my bets by dropping the harsher ingredients of the bowel cleanse like bentonite clay and sticking with the soothing ones like aloe vera and peppermint. Of course this didn’t fix anything. The days and weeks passed, and I sank deeper and deeper into the mercury pit.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There was nobody around me who could help. Even worse, I was losing faith in my ability to help myself. The invisible force I was grappling with was bigger than me, and I didn’t know how long I could keep up the fight. Irrational thoughts and dark feelings took over my head for hours at a time, while in a tiny corner, I held my ground and told myself that it wasn’t real, that it would pass and I would soon feel like myself again. But as time went by, I felt like there was less of ‘me’ and more of ‘it.’ Whatever it was that was chewing up my body and soul was gaining ground.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I tried to communicate what I was experiencing to my therapist. By that point, it had gotten harder to talk. The part of me that could translate my feelings into words seemed like it was eaten up already. But she had a long history of sitting with me, listening patiently, waiting while I found words for the indescribable.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Are you feeling fear?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I paused and considered.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Can you describe it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s a fear of the thing that’s happening to me,” I said, groping for the right words. “I’m afraid because there’s something coming to get me that’s going to destroy me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Who is it?” she asked. “Is there a face?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “It’s not a person.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What is it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Just…destruction,” I said. “This thing that’s going to run though me and tear me apart.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Is it violent?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said. “It’s invisible, it’s quiet.” </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Why does it want to destroy you?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t think it <span class="italic">wants</span> anything,” I said. “This is just what it does. It’ll take me over and I won’t be able to stop it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And then what?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’ll lose,” I said. “My feelings won’t be my real feelings anymore, just torn-up crap. I won’t be me. I‘ll be not-me. The real me will be gone.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took a deep breath. Tears began to leak out of my eyes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s getting closer,” I said. “I feel like I’m standing at the edge of a void. It’s going to reach up and swallow me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She nodded, and took a deep breath.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“This sounds like an existential issue,” she said. “Getting trapped all alone in a vacuum of meaninglessness.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded. This sounded right.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Like there’s nothing good out there,” she said. “No feeling that you’ll be taken care of. Just isolation.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“This kind of stuff can come up around spiritual issues,” she said. “I know you grew up Catholic. Do you believe in God?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nothing? No Higher Power, no life after death?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nope.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And when did that shift occur?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I could tell right away that she was way off the mark. Nothing that was happening inside me was connected to my lack of belief in God. But since I’d paid for the hour, I talked for a while about religion. It was good to feel the back and forth of a normal conversation, even if it did nothing to shed light on my issues. It helped a little just to talk about it, to have someone hear what I was going through.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At the end of the session, she checked in.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So what’s coming up for you this week?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“My birthday.” Birthdays had always been hard for me, and she knew it. They always dropped me into a space of childhood disappointment.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How old are you going to be?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Thirty three,” I said. “The same age as Jesus when he died.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She rolled her eyes. “Did you have to go there?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, I didn’t,” I said. “But if you don’t laugh, you cry, right?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">After my session, I went downtown to the Russian Baths on 10th street. I’d been there before with Margaret when she was in the midst of her cleanse. I hoped that sweating the mercury out would make me feel better. And it did, for a day or so, but then the darkness crowded in again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On my birthday, I cancelled plans to go have dinner in the city with my girlfriend and spent the day in bed, taking stock. What a terrible year it had been. It had started out well with amalgam removal and getting on the gluten free diet, but then everything had gone to hell in a hand basket. All the parasite formula, liver flushes, months of bowel cleansing, aloe vera, sweating, therapy, what did I have to show for it? I was worse off than before I’d done any of it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span class="italic"><span><span class="calibre2">I feel defeated</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre2">, I wrote in my diary. <span class="italic">I’m out of ideas</span>. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had to accept the fact that it was time to give up. No more wasting my time doing internet research. No more learning about bowel cleansing herbs or healing enemas. It was time to stop. I wasn’t able to fix this, and the best thing I could do was admit I was powerless and quit struggling.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It felt good to let go. A quiet peace came over me. I could stop running around like a rat in a maze, encountering the same dead ends over and over again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next time I took out my computer, I didn’t reach for the same google searches. No more typing in ‘heavy metal candida’ or ‘mercury bowel cleanse.’ That exercise in futility was over. I’d put so much energy into it, and at the end of it all, I still didn’t even know if mercury was really my problem. It was just a blind guess. All I’d done was spend months stumbling around on the internet, picking up random ideas.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t regret trying the cleansing. It had cured Margaret, she was someone I knew, I’d watched her go through the process. But mercury poisoning? That was just an abstract idea I’d latched onto. I’d never met anyone who’d had it. I didn’t have the first clue what it looked like, or how a person could even tell if they really had it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I paused for a moment, thinking about that idea. How would a person go about finding out for sure if they had mercury poisoning? Wouldn’t it help if they met someone else who had exactly the same problems they had? Someone who had their fillings out, and then turned into a yeast-filled basket case? Wouldn’t that be very revealing? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">What if I could find someone who was struggling in the exact same way that I was struggling? Someone who was willing to tell the truth about what was going on inside them? Wouldn’t it say so much? Far more than a hundred half-baked internet bullshit articles about mercury and candida ever could?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I brought up google, and my fingers hovered over the keyboard. How exactly could I find a real live mercury toxic person who was willing to tell the actual truth about their life?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I typed in ‘mercury stories’ and hit search.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Bingo.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In the first story, a 34-year-old man talked about how he had increasing depression, fatigue, and a host of mysterious little ailments: <span class="italic">I attributed it all to hypoglycemia and possibly aging. I ate myself into hypoglycemia in my younger years with an unbelievably horrible diet. “Now I'm paying for it,” I thought.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded at the screen. Hypoglycemia and turning into a little old lady. That’s how I’d explained everything for a while too.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But for this man, hypoglycemia didn’t explain everything anymore because he went on to develop chronic yeast infections and very serious depression.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Reading this, I got goose bumps on my arms. It was true, then. Yeast and mercury were connected. I inhaled the rest of his story, and a cog began to turn in my brain when he said that his hypoglycemia disappeared in the weeks following amalgam removal. My hypoglycemia had disappeared in the weeks following amalgam removal too.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In the next mercury story I read, a woman talked about yeast problems too. And I really sat up and paid attention when she talked about getting a mysterious swelling in her salivary glands similar to the episode of the mumps I’d gotten out of the blue when I first got sick. She also had large boils that burst and wept pus. I’d had one of them when I was in college, I’d even had surgery done on it to make sure it healed properly.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next person mentioned yeast too, and then described going on a gluten free diet. The next talked about gluten intolerance and also about having abnormally cold hands and feet, something that my girlfriend frequently pointed out I suffered from. Others talked about their hair falling out. Mine had been falling out since my college days, I had to keep it short to make sure I didn’t kill the bathroom drain wherever I lived.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There was talk of lots of symptoms I didn’t have, like hives, excruciating facial pain, or memory loss. But the hits kept coming. More than one person mentioned chronic constipation. Most everyone talked about the vicious depression, and the feeling that you were aging before your time. My mind pinged with recognition over and over again. I was just like these people, going through so many things that they were going through.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The cog in my brain that had started to turn when I read the first story suddenly engaged with the big wheels in my mind, and something that I’d believed for the past year got turned on its head.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">What if it wasn’t the gluten? Those first marvelous months after I’d seen the dentist, that miraculous improvement? What if it had solely been caused by amalgam removal?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I’d been operating under the impression that getting on the gluten free diet had made everything better. But what if that simply wasn’t true? What if something much deeper had been going on?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My mind ran through everything that had happened to me, all the way back to that first conversation about gluten with the dentist.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Duh. Of course. The dentist! She’d told me to go gluten free. It wasn’t some side issue, some random coincidence. She was mercury toxic too! She’d probably sucked up more mercury in her career than anyone I’d ever met.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My mind buzzed as the facts rearranged themselves into their true order. I’d been wrong all along. I’d thought that celiac, yeast and all my other food intolerances all sprang from the same diseased origin, my congested bowel. I could see that I was right on one level. These problems certainly were connected. But my bowel was just another innocent bystander.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was mercury who was behind all this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Mercury had caused my gluten intolerance. Mercury had given me yeast. I was losing my mind because of mercury, and my hemorrhoid was bleeding because of mercury.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t prove it, but I had a strong feeling that every single health problem I’d had since the age of 16 had mercury’s fingerprints all over it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I finally understood why things had gone so wrong for me, but it still wasn’t clear how to put them right. One of the stories described getting chelation therapy that involved DMPS injections. The guy talked about them as if they were a positive experience, but the side effects sounded brutal. I was going to steer well clear of that treatment. But what else could I try?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The website I was on highly recommended two books on mercury poisoning: <span class="italic">It’s All in Your Head</span> by Hal Huggins and <span class="italic">Amalgam Illness</span> by Andrew Hall Cutler. I ordered both books immediately. In the meantime, I got on the Yahoo group devoted to discussing the Cutler book so I could learn more.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I could feel a knot of fear I’d been carrying inside me for months gradually dissolve. Finally, finally I had found out what was wrong. Armed with the right information, I could do whatever needed to be done to fix it all up in no time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I heaved a sigh of relief. Any minute now it would all be over, and I’d finally get my life back.</span></span></span></p>
