<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">D</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">ULL METAL AND BLOOD GLEAMED IN THE SUNSHINE, AND THE</span></span> sound of a melee filled Mel Riley’s ears. Rocks, sticks, axes, arrows whizzed past his head. Dust was everywhere, almost choking him. He was in the middle of some kind of battle, on a hillside in a strange place, at a strange time, down in the most magical, frightening part of the zone, and he was physically ducking the arrows, hunching down in his chair to shield himself, and coughing from the dust.… And then Ed Dames’s voice rose and pulled him out of it, and the <a id="filepos736618"></a>bilocation was over and Mel Riley was back, at Fort Meade, in the CRV room in building 2560. Dames, now chuckling from across the table, handed Riley the feedback folder; it was a training target, some five-hundred-year-old battle in Cornwall.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Yes, Mel Riley was back, after all these years.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the summer of 1984, stranded in Germany without a posting, he had abruptly been assigned to the Pentagon’s <a id="filepos737179"></a>Rapid Deployment Force (<a id="filepos737211"></a>RDF). It was based in Savannah, Georgia, and that was where Riley went to live for the next few years. They were difficult years. The RDF was conducting a number of politically sensitive operations in Central America at the time, mostly from Honduras, one of the bases for U.S. operations against Sandinista-controlled Nicaragua. Riley’s battalion ran reconnaissance missions with an odd-looking Army propeller plane called the Mohawk; it carried a massive side-looking radar pod, to track the movements of vehicles and personnel through the steamy jungles of the region.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Within the battalion Riley was first sergeant for a company of about forty men and women. He had to get up every morning at four-thirty to lead all the enlisted personnel through a several-mile run and intensive calisthenics; he usually didn’t finish his work until well into the evening. He was starting to feel too old for that kind of thing. Other soldiers in the unit were starting to feel the pressure too; Riley once had to disarm a staff sergeant who waved around a 9 mm handgun and threatened to kill the company commander.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In 1985 Mel and Brigitte finally divorced; she got custody of their daughters, and moved to Texas. Not long afterwards Riley met another German-born woman, Edith, ex-wife of an RDF soldier. Edith had had some psychic experiences herself, as a child, and didn’t seem to mind at all that Mel had been, and hoped to be again, a remote viewer. So life wasn’t all bad. They were married later that year.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When the situation at Fort Meade had stabilized, and it was clear that the DIA would keep the remote-viewing unit alive, Skip Atwater arranged a transfer for Riley. It wasn’t easy; the Army’s Personnel Command, which wanted to keep Riley at the RDF, had to be overridden by Jack Vorona’s office at the DIA. But the deal was done, and in the summer of 1986, after a five-year absence, Riley finally <a id="filepos739385"></a>arrived back at Fort Meade, ready to serve out the remainder of his Army career in the two wooden buildings under the trees on Llewellyn Street.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The unit meanwhile had undergone yet another name change. As part of the Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate at DIA, it had the unit prefix DT. Its specific unit designation was S, for “special,” and so it was known as DT-S. The unit’s old Army code name, Center Lane, had been replaced by a new DIA code name, Sun Streak.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The only faces Riley recognized at the unit now were Atwater’s and Fern Gauvin’s. Back in 1981, after the Iran hostage rescue debacle, Gauvin had sworn he would never professionally remote-view again. He had kept that oath, more or less, for he had now been hired back only as a monitor and analyst.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The unit commander—or “branch chief,” as he was known within the DIA’s bureaucracy—was Bill Ray. Under him worked the operations officer, still Skip Atwater, who in turn ran three assistant operations officers, who served as monitors and analysts for RV sessions. The assistant operations officers were Ed Dames, Fern Gauvin, and a burly, mustachioed Army warrant officer named Gene Kincaid. When a tasking came in, Dames, Gauvin, and Kincaid each would be assigned a different team of remote viewers to run against the target. Remote viewers themselves were now often referred to as “sources,” to play up the analogy with ordinary secret agents controlled by case officers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To Riley, it seemed that the unit was full of interesting characters. There was Ed Dames, who always seemed to be bouncing on the balls of his feet, restlessly planning some new psychic conquest of foreign adversaries’ secrets. There was Paul Smith, the gentle Mormon with his heavy metal music. And there was Gene Kincaid, who had had a sensationally interesting Army career.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Like the late Jackie Keith, Kincaid had been an INSCOM <a id="filepos741731"></a>covert operative. Among his many operations, curiously enough, had been the purchase of the Soviet T-72 tank, six or seven years before. After helping set up the deal, Kincaid had been taken off the case because he had been just a warrant officer; only senior DIA or CIA or National Security Council officials had been included in the operation’s final stages. Kincaid had always wondered how the deal had turned out. Atwater showed him: He opened the files and pulled out Joe McMoneagle’s and Hartleigh Trent’s and Mel Riley’s RV sessions, which provided a psychic’s-eye view of the operation from start to finish.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kincaid was a wonderful storyteller, and was best known for his account of his near death in Vietnam. He had been a HUMINT specialist, running agents and working with the CIA. One time he was riding in a helicopter, near a small skirmish that was under way, when the copter began to take ground fire. He and the pilot were hit; Kincaid caught a bullet in the leg and in the stomach. The helicopter crash-landed, and Kincaid tumbled bloodily out. By the time the fire zone was secure and a medic found him, he was so far gone that he was virtually left for dead. There didn’t seem to be any point in evacuating him ahead of the others who had a better chance. Eventually, after everyone else had been evacuated, he was picked up and put inside a medevac helicopter. He had lost a tremendous amount of blood; he felt his life slipping away. He felt like sleeping, but for some reason he decided that if he closed his eyes, he would die. <em class="calibre4">Gotta stay awake</em>, he kept telling himself. The helicopter brought him to an Army hospital, where he found himself in a room with several other badly wounded soldiers. The doctor looked at Kincaid, shook his head, and then a priest came in and gave him last rites while the doctor went to work on the others. <em class="calibre4">Gotta stay awake</em> … Finally the doctor finished with the others and came over. Kincaid let go and closed his eyes, but instead of falling asleep, he drifted out of his body. He floated down the hall to another operating <a id="filepos743970"></a>room where doctors were working over a young Marine with badly wounded legs. He heard the doctors conferring over the Marine, and he found himself caught up in the drama of the operation. Eventually, Kincaid drifted out of the operating room, into an intensely bright light, and he was enveloped by love, and in the end he woke up with tubes sticking out of him in his own hospital bed. He checked with the hospital staff, and found that the details about the young Marine and his operation were accurate. Later, Kincaid told a priest about the experience; the priest assured him that it was the kind of thing that sometimes happened to people <em class="calibre4">in extremis</em>, and was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Kincaid and Riley and others who arrived after the end of Ingo Swann’s training program now trained in CRV with those who had been trained by Swann. Some in the unit would still use deeper altered-state methods (ERV), but most would be able to do either. Atwater often employed viewers in CRV mode to acquire a target, and then ran some of them in ERV mode for the more in-depth work.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann had ordered his trainees always to use geographical coordinates, insisting that that method would always be superior to others. But when they went on RV duty back at Fort Meade, the trainees quickly abandoned the geographical coordinate scheme. Wherever they might have written down a target’s latitude and longitude in a session, they now used two four-digit <em class="calibre4">random</em> numbers instead. To placate Swann a bit, and perhaps to make remote viewing seem less arbitrary and bizarre, they called these random numbers “encrypted coordinates,” as if they had some relationship to actual geographical coordinates, although they didn’t. They still referred to the technique as CRV.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Now freed from the constraints of physical geography, these random numbers were like addresses in the ethereal Matrix. They could be used to refer to anything—locations, <a id="filepos746172"></a>people, possible events, objects. Swann shook his head and muttered apocalyptic warnings about this violation of his teaching, but no one took much notice. As Hal Puthoff had found at SRI when he tried abandoning geographical coordinates, there was no apparent decline in the quality of the data, at least not against ordinary targets. In fact, like Keith Harary and Gary Langford out at SRI, the remote viewers at DT-S found that geographical coordinates were apt to generate analytical overlay, spurring them to wonder where the coordinates had put them on the globe. With only random numbers to go by, there were no such distractions.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In April 1986, just before Riley arrived for his second tour, DT-S was given a target relating to a planned U.S. air raid on Libya and Muammar Qaddafi. The raid was meant by the Reagan administration as revenge for the bombing death of an American G.I. in Berlin, and as a general deterrent to Libya’s increasingly bold sponsorship of international terrorism. In a nighttime strike, dozens of sites in Tripoli, Benghazi, and surrounding areas would be attacked by U.S. Navy and Air Force jets. The targets would include government buildings, suspected chemical weapons plants, terrorist training camps, and the nerve center of the Libyan armed forces—Qaddafi himself. DT-S was asked to help track Qaddafi, as he jumped from safe house to bunker to desert tent, nervously aware that the American military wanted to put him in its sights.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The unit worked long hours on the job, sketching various buildings and encampments. Later, after the raid, some of the photographs and diagrams of Qaddafi’s hideaways would appear in the newspaper, and there would seem to be similarities to what some of the remote viewers had described. But as the remote viewers worked the target, they were faced with a serious problem: Even if they were perfectly accurate, and they weren’t, they couldn’t get their information up the chain of command before Qaddafi moved somewhere else. Eventually, they tried to describe <a></a>Qaddafi’s location a certain number of hours or days in the future, to compensate for the delay. But they never had the impression that their data had made a difference. It seemed that Qaddafi’s final location was plotted—and in the end, almost pinpointed—by a combination of human agents in Tripoli, overhead reconnaissance photos, and signals intelligence intercepts. On the night of the raid, the Bedouin-style camp where Qaddafi was hiding out was hit by several bombs; they missed their prime target by only a few hundred yards.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After the raid, a U.S. F-111 long-range bomber went down offshore; the remote-viewing unit was at work trying to find it when Ken Bell, now at another, unrelated posting, telephoned. He had remote-viewed the F-111 from his home, and believed he knew where it was on the bottom of the Gulf of Sidra. It would later turn out that Bell’s information was reasonably accurate, but again, it didn’t seem to have been used.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A few years later, in December 1989, a similar RV operation would be mounted against Manuel Noriega in Panama. In the wake of the American invasion of that country, Noriega went into hiding, and DT-S was asked to help find him. For several days of intense work the unit described a variety of locations. As with the Libya raid, some of the remote viewers’ information in retrospect would seem to have been accurate, but it was never precise enough, or consistent enough. At one point Lyn Buchanan told his session monitor he had received a powerful impulse regarding Noriega’s location. The impulse was telling him that the location was somehow known to the young American television actress Kristy McNichol. “<a id="filepos750271"></a>Ask Kristy McNichol,” he kept writing on his session paper. “Ask Kristy McNichol.” But no one checked with Kristy McNichol, and the U.S. government never “caught” Noriega. He surfaced on his own, inside the Vatican embassy, and was later imprisoned in the United States and convicted of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos750691"></a>Other operations in the Sun Streak years involved suspected <a id="filepos750759"></a>high-tech weapons sites in the Soviet Union. Many of these were tasked by Dale Graff, who now ran something called the Advanced Concepts Office within Jack Vorona’s Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate. One target, brought in early in 1987, was a satellite-tracking and communications facility at Dushanbe in the USSR, with large lasers pointed skyward. Mel Riley, Paul Smith, and other remote viewers using the CRV technique described lasers and, eight to nine months in the future, large igloos or domes—which in fact did begin to be constructed, six months later.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">DT-S was also involved in the lengthy <a id="filepos751471"></a>Lebanon hostage crisis, and tried to track the locations and the health of Terry Anderson, Terry Waite, and other Western captives. In some cases they reviewed video footage taken on reconnaissance flights by remotely piloted vehicles, and tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to point out buildings where they thought hostages were being held. Riley, Smith, and others also provided data on Iranian weapons emplacements—especially Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles—along the Persian Gulf during the later stages of the Iran-Iraq War.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One category of tasking that expanded in the late 1980s had to do with counter-narcotics operations. The U.S. Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and various Pentagon anti-drug offices and task forces became occasional customers of DT-S. The viewers were asked to peek inside suspected drug-smuggling vessels on the high seas, or to track the activities of certain drug cartel members south of the border. In a few cases in 1988 and 1989, the unit provided information on the whereabouts of suspected drug ships that was later confirmed to have been broadly accurate. <a id="filepos752703"></a>Probably the most clear-cut success for the unit, in the Sun Streak years, was an operation tasked by Brigadier General James Shufelt, a former deputy commander of INSCOM who had moved to a senior position at the DIA. Shufelt was already well known to those in the program, having married remote viewer Charlene Cavanaugh in 1986 (in a ceremony attended by many of those in the program, including Ingo Swann). One day, later that year, Shufelt and his new wife invited Skip Atwater over for dinner, and Shufelt told him about the tasking he’d just received. The Pentagon was getting pressure from veterans’ groups, via Congress, to investigate the widespread stories about American POWs still being held captive in Vietnam. The stories were mostly tenuous, but they had raised enormous hopes in the veterans community. A small grass-roots movement had begun, supported by influential political and business figures such as Ross Perot. The Pentagon was now telling Shufelt to check the stories out and report his findings to Congress. Shufelt had the resources of the DIA at his disposal: satellite pictures, communications intercepts, the works. He wanted Atwater’s remote viewers to help out, too.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater suggested that Shufelt task the operation as a kind of controlled experiment. He should provide the unit with two sets of photos—one of buildings in Vietnam where it was rumored that POWs were being held, and the other of buildings in Vietnam where it was known for certain that there were <em class="calibre4">no</em> POWs. Neither Atwater nor anyone else in the remote-viewing unit would be told which photograph belonged to which category. That way, Shufelt would at least have some way of judging how reliable the RV information was likely to be.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Shufelt sent the photos over—there were several dozen of them in all—and Atwater put them all into target envelopes. Then he set up two RV teams, one headed by Ed Dames and the other by Gene Kincaid. Neither Dames nor Kincaid knew that the photographs were from Vietnam, or <a id="filepos754912"></a>knew what the operation was about. Kincaid, running viewers in ERV mode, would show the photos to some of them as front-loading, but Dames gave his viewers only the random-number “coordinates” that had been assigned to the photos.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater spread the operation out over several months, to keep the remote viewers from burning out or generating Aol from too many related targets. When all the data were in, he analyzed them and wrote a final report. His conclusion was straightforward: The remote viewers had found no POWs anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater forwarded the report to Shufelt, who read it with genuine dismay. “That’s just sad; that’s just awful,” he told Atwater. In the end, his other sources pointed towards the same conclusion. Shufelt told Congress he had come up empty-handed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The POWs-in-Vietnam operation was one of the last big ones for Atwater. At the time it began, he was already in retirement mode, and had begun to transfer his duties to Fern Gauvin.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Back in 1982, Atwater had purchased some land near the Monroe Institute. Since then, with one of his teenage sons, he had been spending weekends down at his property, building a house. The house grew up slowly; it seemed to evolve out of the Blue Ridge ground. After five years, in late 1987, it was ready to be occupied, and Atwater was ready to retire. On his last day at Fort Meade, there was a small gathering, and he was ceremoniously given a coffee cup. There was some standard novelty-shop message on it; something about not having anyone to boss around now that he was retired. He thanked everyone, then cleaned out his desk, and went home. He and his wife Joan and their children moved down to the new house near the Monroe Institute. Bob Monroe made him director of research at the institute, and in an office looking out over the hills, Atwater <a id="filepos757066"></a>studied brain waves, created new Hemi-Sync tapes, and generally tried to enjoy life.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">When Mel Riley arrived at Fort Meade in the summer of 1986, he was overjoyed to be back. But it was soon clear to him, as it had been to others, that the unit had entered a decline. It seemed to have been discredited forever, in some eyes, by its expulsion from the Army.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Matters became worse in 1988, when Major General Harry Soyster, who had taken over INSCOM after Stubblebine and had favored the RV unit’s expulsion, was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed to head the DIA. Soyster didn’t want the remote-viewing program at DIA any more than he had wanted it at INSCOM. He wasn’t completely opposed to the idea that remote viewing was a genuine phenomenon, but for the present, RV data just seemed to him to be too flaky to use in military situations. He worried about the giggle factor.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Remarkably, despite the opposition of Soyster and some of his top deputies, Jack Vorona was able to keep the unit afloat. He and Dale Graff maintained a network of supportive intelligence officials in the Pentagon, the DEA, the CIA, and other agencies; these officials could task DT-S on a low-key, experimental, cost-free basis, and could use the results as they saw fit. A number of the remote viewers travelled around the country, giving demonstrations to potential customers. In one case, Paul Smith, monitored by Lyn Buchanan, did a successful demonstration for officials of the Pentagon’s anti-drug Joint Task Force Four in Key West, Florida.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There were also demonstrations for key people from Congress. Smith and a young Army civilian named Gabrielle Peters were sent to Capitol Hill one day. Peters, a former member of INSCOM’s SED group, and a former tasker of the remote-viewing unit, was now a remote viewer herself, and apparently a talented one. She and Smith were <a id="filepos759259"></a>greeted on the Hill by four <a id="filepos759295"></a>supportive senators from the Intelligence Committee—William Cohen (R-Maine), Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), and former astronaut John Glenn (D-Ohio). Dick D’Amato, an aide who handled intelligence-budget issues for Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, was there, too. In a room in the Russell Senate Office Building, D’Amato and the senators handed Smith two four-digit random numbers, indicating a site somewhere in the world. Smith read the numbers to Peters, who worked the target. It turned out to be a terrorism-related facility in Libya, and Peters did well enough to earn surprised looks and warm congratulations from the assembled legislators.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Demonstrations such as these might not have amounted to hard-nosed proof of the day-to-day usefulness of remote viewing, but they tended to shake people up, impressing them with the reality of the paranormal so much that they didn’t want to see the program die. With support from Cohen and Inouye and D’Amato and the others, the program stayed alive. And through the informal networks Vorona and Graff had set up, DT-S was occasionally able to bypass the DIA’s skeptical leadership, getting its results into the hands of those who could make use of them.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The problem, of course, was that no program could last long operating in such a furtive manner. As part of the DIA, which was primarily an analytical agency, the unit wasn’t really supposed to be running operations anyway. And officially, almost no one in Congress or the intelligence community now wanted to be seen sanctioning the use of remote viewers for anything more than “experimentation.” Even if a remote viewing of a specific target proved to have been accurate and useful, its user, afraid of the giggle factor, could almost never acknowledge the fact. Officers at Joint Task Force Four in Key West, for example, were relatively enthusiastic about remote viewing’s potential, and believed that some of the data they had received <a id="filepos761482"></a>had been operationally useful, but they employed remote viewers only a few times, semi-officially, afraid that their association with DT-S might get them in trouble with their superiors.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As the unit’s bureaucratic marginalization increased, it also seemed to decay in other ways. Its clients were now increasingly interested in <a id="filepos761897"></a>search problems—searches for drug-carrying ships, and terrorists, and fugitives like Noriega. Desperate for support, the unit’s managers didn’t want to turn taskings down. And yet search problems had always been the most difficult for remote viewers: The more search problems they did, the more their overall success rate fell.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The unit seemed to be well past its prime anyway, in terms of raw remote-viewing ability. For all the enthusiasm over Swann’s multi-stage CRV technique, it seemed that there was no one in the unit with the consistency and the clarity of the great “naturals” like Pat Price, Joe McMoneagle, and Ken Bell. The last two, McMoneagle and Bell, were now working as civilians for SRI, and had largely supplanted Swann there. Going through samples of some of the DT-S operational data one day in 1989, out at SRI, McMoneagle would find a recent session against the same Severodvinsk shipyard he had been targeted against by the National Security Council in 1979. As he leafed through the session sheets, it seemed to him that the sketches were the same ones <em class="calibre4">he</em> had made a decade before, against the <em class="calibre4">Typhoon</em> submarine. He became convinced that someone at DT-S had spruced up his old session and put a new date and viewer number on it, to make it look like original data. The analysis of the session suggested that the Soviets were building a new high-tech sub at Severodvinsk. It was one of the apparently successful sessions that the RV program managers were using in briefings around the intelligence community. McMoneagle wondered how things could have become so bad at Fort Meade.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><a id="filepos763700"></a><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2">Fern Gauvin had seemed a good choice when he replaced Skip Atwater as operations officer in 1987, and became DT-S’s branch chief a year later. Gauvin had more experience than anyone else at the unit, and had worked as both a monitor and a viewer.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But in the years of Gauvin’s reign, the unit’s decline worsened. There were rivalries, accusations of mismanagement, and operational failures. To hear some remote viewers tell it, the unit was slipping into paranormal chaos—a dark place, infested by madness and mischievous sprites, as in one of those paintings by Hieronymus Bosch. When it was over, as Lyn Buchanan would say later, “we didn’t have any customers left.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Gauvin, in an interview years later, would reject suggestions that he had spent too much time out there in the Matrix—had flown too high in the paranormal sky. But in discussing the potential dangers of remote viewing, he conveyed a worldview very different from that of the average DIA branch chief.</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">The biggest concern is—will I be invaded by evil spirits? Maybe, but I can protect myself … Some other people call it, Okay, “cover yourself with the white light,” and so on. All that is good intention. And if I have good intention—I don’t care if you [a seductive evil spirit] are a whore on Fourteenth Street, I don’t want anything to do with you—then you don’t stand a chance, I don’t care what the price. It’s because I don’t want to. I think that goes a long way in this line of work.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_22"><p class="calibre_6">I’ve seen intrusions, temporary intrusions, but you know, nothing that could affect anybody or anything if they didn’t want to be bothered. That’s speaking broadly. It was never a huge problem.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos766113"></a>In general, Gauvin preached pluralism when it came to remote-viewing styles: Whatever technique someone liked to use, he or she should use. He respected CRV and the accomplishments of Ingo Swann, but he felt that CRV was now somehow too intellectual, too concerned with method rather than results. Skip Atwater had also been relatively pluralistic, but he had come to believe that a certain amount of standardization of techniques was necessary. He and Bill Ray had effectively restricted remote viewers to two basic styles, ERV and CRV. Under Gauvin, however, these restrictions were off. Other, more exotic styles were introduced. And the sprites came out to play.</p>
<p class="calibre_23"><a id="filepos766858"></a>Angela Dellafiora, a raven-haired woman in her forties, had joined the unit early in 1986. Prior to that she had been an INSCOM civilian, a Latin American analyst. She had seemed dissatisfied with her job, and had felt drawn to the paranormal realm instead. She had attended a private psychic training institute in Washington, D.C., and somehow Stubblebine, then still at INSCOM, had heard about her. She had become the third (after Lyn Buchanan and Dawn Lutz) of his handpicked recruits for the remote-viewing unit. Because of the near death of the unit in 1984, her transfer had been delayed, and she had arrived only when the unit was transferred to DIA control.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">While Atwater was operations officer, Dellafiora almost always worked with ERV, and, though she disliked the technique, she also trained briefly in CRV with Paul Smith (who did lectures) and Ed Dames and Lyn Buchanan (who ran practice sessions). At times she seemed to have some talent, but she didn’t seem exceptional.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the Fern Gauvin era, and evidently with Gauvin’s encouragement, Dellafiora began to use a different technique to access targets. She would go into one of the RV rooms, would relax into a trance, and then after a while would announce the presence of an outside entity that had <a></a>supposedly possessed her body. “Maurice” was her most common possessor. There was also “George,” and a character who called himself “Dr. Einstein.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">These entities tended to manifest themselves not vocally, but through what is known as “automatic writing.” They would seize control of Angela’s writing hand, and use it to set down their comments on a given target. Gauvin, who often served as monitor for these sessions, would sit across the table, asking the entity questions: <em class="calibre4">What is the health of the hostage Terry Waite?</em></p>
<p class="calibre_14"><span><span class="calibre13">HE IS HUNGRY AND WEAK AND FRIGHTENED, BUT OTHERWISE ALL RIGHT</span></span>, might come the response.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Later, Angela would emerge from her trance to find a few dozen sheets of data before her, neatly filled out in her familiar spirit’s handwriting.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Angela’s form of remote viewing came to be known as written-RV, or WRV, although it was essentially a form of spirit mediumship—in modern parlance, “channelling.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Channellers, such as the séance-room performer Mina “Margery” Crandon, had brought much discredit upon psychic research a century or so before. Now the theatrical practice was rearing its head again. And yet Angela, freed to channel, suddenly seemed to become one of the most accurate and reliable sources in the unit.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the spring of 1989, the <a id="filepos770159"></a>U.S. Customs Service asked DT-S to help find a former Customs officer, Charles Jordan, who was wanted for various crimes and was believed to be hiding out in the Caribbean. The CRVers described him in a variety of places including the Caribbean, South Florida, and even Central America. It seemed that they were zeroing in on him, but Angela, seized by one of her spirits, located Jordan somewhere else—in northern Wyoming, near the town of Lovell and also not far from an old Indian burial ground. The Customs Service decided to ignore all this conflicting information, but not long thereafter, Jordan was spotted by a ranger at Yellowstone National <a id="filepos770825"></a>Park—a few dozen miles from Lovell, Wyoming—and was arrested. Under interrogation, Jordan admitted to having been near Lovell around the time Angela had psychically placed him there.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In another case in 1989, Angela was asked how Muammar Qaddafi was reacting to recent U.S. charges that Libya was fabricating chemical weapons in the town of Rabta. She announced that a ship, the “Patua” or “Potua,” would arrive at Tripoli to transport chemical weapons materials from Rabta to a different town, via the eastern Libyan port of Ras al Anuf. She seemed to have been close: A ship named the <em class="calibre4">Batato</em> did dock at Tripoli four days later, loaded an unknown cargo, and sailed for the eastern Libyan port of Benghazi.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Later that year, in mid-July, Angela spontaneously predicted that a U.S. passenger aircraft would be <a id="filepos771836"></a>hijacked from Rome or Athens in a few weeks. And within three weeks, U.S. intelligence heard from other sources that just such an attack, though ultimately cancelled, was being planned by Islamic terrorists. A few months later, during the search for Noriega in Panama, Angela’s RV sessions seemed so good that they were the only ones actually sent “downtown” to DT-S’s friends in the Pentagon.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The male remote viewers in the unit didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. A channeller—<em class="calibre4">a channeller</em>—was taking over the U.S. government’s psychic spying program. Dames and Riley and the others began to refer to Angela’s possessing entities as “the boys,” or “The Three Stooges.” But while they joked about it, they also hoped that those at the upper levels of the program would come to their senses. They, the Jedi knights of CRV, had been trained by Swann or by Swann’s trainees, and had been taught to regard the multi-stage CRV system as a quantum leap over all the old psychic methods. Now with Angela and her entities, they lamented, the unit was regressing from Ingo Swann’s high <a id="filepos773110"></a>tech wizardry back to archaic and vaguely feminist witchery.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Some of the CRVers were willing to believe that Angela did have real, natural talent. That much they conceded. But most thought that she was prone to wild errors, and that with proper management, a team of CRVers could beat her every time. The Higgins operation, they liked to say, was a good example.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In February 1988, a senior U.S. Marine officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Higgins, was kidnapped from Beirut by the Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah. DT-S was asked to try to find him. Ed Dames, running a team of CRVers, came up with a description of a house where it seemed that Higgins was being held in South Lebanon. Angela Dellafiora, front-loaded with reconnaissance photographs of the area and monitored by Fern Gauvin, picked out instead a certain field near a road; she believed that Higgins was being held underground there, somehow. Several days later, the CRVers began to report that Higgins was dead. Angela reported that he was alive, and would soon be released. Both sets of data were sent downtown, but of course they conflicted, and were probably ignored.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Higgins’s body was soon found, tortured to death, and it turned out that he had probably been in a house in South Lebanon, perhaps like the one the CRVers had described. Angela had been wrong. Dames bitterly criticized the “vitiation” of the CRV data by Angela’s channelling.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Even when Angela seemed to have been successful in her channelling, the CRVers sometimes suggested that her performance hadn’t been entirely paranormal. At the meeting with Joint Task Force Four officials in Key West, where Smith and Buchanan did a demonstration target, Angela was also present, and was given her own target—a person. Angela, according to the story, began by asking whether the target person was male.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Informed by the base officials that the target person was <a id="filepos775411"></a>not male, but was in fact female, Angela suggested that this female person nevertheless had male tendencies. The session went on like this, Angela getting closer and closer to the target and Smith and Buchanan getting more and more disgusted, until Angela began to describe the target relatively accurately. The base officials seemed impressed. But Smith and Buchanan concluded that Angela, despite a genuine psi ability, was too often inadvertently coached towards targets by her customers’ questions and answers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As time went on, and the rivalry intensified, some of the CRVers began to allege that, whether Angela meant it or not, she had a <a id="filepos776142"></a>mesmerizing influence over one or two of the program’s managers. There was something about a woman in an exotic altered state of consciousness, it seemed, that couldn’t help stirring a man’s deepest emotions. In any case, the CRVers would talk about how Gauvin would disappear with Angela into the ops building now and then, each time returning an hour or so later, his eyes bright and dreamy, as if he had just heard some blissful revelation. No one ever seriously suggested that Gauvin (or anyone else in the program) had a sexual relationship with Dellafiora; instead, they believed that Gauvin was going in for private readings, and was simply becoming emotionally dependent on them. Eventually, Gauvin confided to Riley that he had indeed been consulting Angela on various private matters, such as the Maryland horse farm he had long wanted to buy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By late 1988, Jack Vorona himself was driving up from DIA headquarters, sometimes accompanied by a friendly congressman or staffer, to do occasional sessions with Angela. Vorona would later assert that these visits had been entirely for professional reasons. In other words, all the targets he brought had been operations-related—Angela was said to be especially good against human targets—or at least had served as some kind of legitimate test of her ability. Still, the CRVers were perplexed and annoyed that the <a></a>same targets were never given to them, especially when they had so much time on their hands. After all the effort that had gone into the development of CRV, the managers of the program seemed to be discarding it.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In 1988 a young woman named Robin <a id="filepos777951"></a>Dahlgren arrived at the unit. She had been among fifty or so DIA employees tested with a computer psi-ability analyzer that Ed May had developed out at SRI. Apparently she had done well, although for some reason she had declined to take any of the usual personality tests that went with it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dahlgren was in her late twenties, slim, attractive, dark haired, a chain-smoker. She had a cackling laugh, and a certain T-shirt she sometimes wore, one of those things you see at the seashore resorts; across her chest it read: “90% bitch, 10% angel.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ed Dames, who drew the task of training Dahlgren in CRV, wondered where to find the 10 percent angel. Dahlgren made clear that she despised the complexities and rigidities of the technique, and one day, when Dames spoke to her sharply about some mistake she had made, she simply burst into tears and refused to go on. Later, when her training was finished, she vowed never to use CRV. She preferred a free-form, ERV-type style, she said. Encouraged by Angela’s example, she also began to experiment with more archaic techniques. She began to work with tarot cards, and even began to practice channelling.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Unfortunately, as the CRVers saw it, Dahlgren’s psi abilities were insignificant no matter what technique she used. In one long session against a certain operational target, she was able to determine only that “there is blue at the site.” Another time, she pinpointed the location of an unknown object in the middle of the Arizona desert. The target, it turned out, was a drug-smuggling ship being tracked in the Atlantic by the Coast Guard. Paul Smith, before leaving the unit in the early 1990s, would perform a statistical evaluation <a id="filepos779903"></a>of several RVers’ performances against a selected group of operational targets, and would conclude that Dahlgren was the only one whose data had no significant correlation with the targets.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dahlgren nevertheless seemed to do as she liked within the unit. Some wondered whether it had anything to do with her relationship to Dick D’Amato.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">D’Amato, the senior aide to Senator Robert Byrd, was one of those men who are seldom in the public eye, yet have enormous, world-class power. As one of Byrd’s key lieutenants on the Senate Appropriations Committee, he was in charge of intelligence and black-projects appropriations, and had a long list of special-access clearances. He was one of the few people with the effective authority to determine what stayed in, and what came out of, the annual intelligence budget. One of the aims he had in wielding that power was, evidently, to keep the Fort Meade remote-viewing unit alive.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Over at the CIA, there was growing skepticism about the entire remote-viewing program. Ron Pandolfi, a CIA scientist who had been tasked with monitoring new and exotic technologies, including remote viewing, had been battling for years with Jack Vorona and Dale Graff over access to Sun Streak. But Vorona and Graff managed to keep him off the clearance list; Pandolfi, in their opinion, only wanted to shut the program down forever.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Thwarted by the DIA, Pandolfi turned to Capitol Hill. In visits to staffers on the intelligence committees, he would ask why they had signed off on the Sun Streak budget request. Did they know what that million or so dollars was for? Every time, he would receive the same answer: Dick D’Amato, carrying the sceptre of Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, had himself inserted Sun Streak into the DIA’s budget. The head of the DIA, Harry Soyster, apparently did not even want the project, but D’Amato had marked it up in the DIA’s part of the intelligence appropriations <a id="filepos782182"></a>bill anyway. Why, Pandolfi wanted to know, did the staffers not question this? The response said a lot about the politics of espionage: “Well, you know, Ron, if we did that, then every time <em class="calibre4">we</em> came up with a markup, he’d just shoot us down.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The relationship between the attractive tarot-card reader and the powerful Senate staffer was relatively out in the open. Everyone in the program seemed to know about it, from the remote viewers on up to senior DIA officials. When several unit members took a trip to Israel to see if RV could work better at close range to Middle Eastern targets, D’Amato came along, too, and disappeared with Dahlgren for several days. One DIA official figured that D’Amato had simply “lost sight of logic.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In one obvious sense, the D’Amato/Dahlgren connection appeared to be a boon for the unit. However scrupulously D’Amato might have separated work and play—and perhaps he did<a id="filepos783317" href="#filepos784632">*</a>—members of the remote-viewing unit suspected that the unit owed its continued existence to D’Amato’s amatory inducement.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Yet every silver lining has its cloud. To the managers of the program, it appeared that Robin Dahlgren could not be fired, and could not be given instructions or orders as if she were any other remote viewer. It was believed that if anyone seriously crossed her, then D’Amato would respond by forcing the removal of managers from their positions, or even shutting down the unit altogether. “If I said something to her in the afternoon,” one former manager would later remember, “I would hear about it the next morning from [DIA] headquarters.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>In any case, D’Amato did exert a substantial influence on the unit, not just where Dahlgren was concerned. As time went on, the view spread that he was “micromanaging” the program—and perhaps in this he was guided by the advice of Dahlgren, who in turn was informed by her magical cards.</p>
