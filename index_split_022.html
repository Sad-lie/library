<p class="calibre_14">One of Price’s more startling psychic spying attempts began on the afternoon of Tuesday, February 5, 1974. Hal Puthoff was sitting at his desk when his branch chief Earle Jones walked into his office bearing a message from the Berkeley police: They wanted some paranormal assistance.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The night before, as everyone knew by now from the radio and the TV news, the daughter of newspaper magnate Randolph Hearst had been kidnapped. By whom, no one yet knew, but Hearst’s fortune pointed to a likely motive. The Berkeley police, having heard of the psychic feats at SRI, wanted to see if Puthoff’s remote viewers could help them get a jump on the kidnappers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Pat Price met the police that afternoon at Patty Hearst’s apartment, and Price had a chance to look <a></a>around the place and pick up impressions. He surprised everyone by saying immediately that he didn’t feel the kidnapping was about money, but was more of a political, terroristic act designed to draw attention and sympathy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Afterwards, they went over to the police station, and Price went through volume after volume of unlabeled mug shots—the usual suspects, plus some others. He picked out three. He pointed to one, of a young man, and told the police that the name Lobo came to him, <em class="calibre4">lobo</em> being Spanish for “wolf.” This man Lobo, said Price, was something of a kindred spirit, shamanically speaking. He had extraordinary mental control. For instance, he had recently had his teeth pulled at the dentist without anesthesia, relying instead upon self-hypnosis.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Two days later police received the first of a series of “communiqués” from the kidnappers. As Price had predicted, they did not demand money; instead they demanded food for the poor. They called themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. Eventually the police and FBI also determined that the three men Price had selected from the mug shot book were members of the group. The one Price had called Lobo was a Berkeley dropout named William Wolfe; “Willie the Wolf” was one of his nicknames. Police even confirmed the bizarre anecdote about Wolfe’s anesthetic-free dental surgery.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It was all very encouraging, but Price’s main task was to find Hearst’s whereabouts. For this, Puthoff served as his Dr. Watson, following him around whenever he was working on the case, making tape recordings and notes of his comments, organizing his sketches, chauffeuring him to various locations. At first Price tried to find Hearst the direct way, by describing her surroundings in enough detail that the police could zero in on the precise address. But though he could vividly see her locked in a closet in someone’s house—as she indeed was at the time—he was ultimately unable to move his psi perception smoothly outside <a></a>and to the nearest corner, where he might have read the street names. He watched her daily, in helpless frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In time Price began trying to find Patty Hearst indirectly, by triangulating her position. Puthoff would drive him to some spot in the Bay Area, and Price would sit and wait for an impression of the direction of her kidnappers’ hideout. It was as if there were some kind of compass in his brain, with Patty Hearst at true north. When Price had an impression of Hearst’s direction, Puthoff would plot their position along with the indicated direction on a map of the area, repeating the sequence for different positions around the Bay Area. The idea was that after several impressions from different places had been received, the lines would cross somewhere. Puthoff and Price would then go to the crossing area and triangulate further, and when they had circled close enough to their quarry, the lines would finally converge upon a given house, which police could then burst into and free the abducted heiress. That was the idea, anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By early April, unfortunately, Hearst had begun to sound less like a damsel in distress than a crazed terrorist herself. The SLA released a tape-recorded statement in which she said she wanted to “stay and fight” with the group. She was soon photographed with other SLA members as they carried out a bank robbery in San Francisco. Nevertheless, Price doggedly stayed on the case, coming up with some new clue every week. One day in May, he told Puthoff he wanted to do one more scan of the Bay Area. He felt confident that they were going to find her this time. But the following day, before they had had a chance to set out, police cornered and killed a group of SLA members (including William Wolfe, who had become Hearst’s lover) in a building in Los Angeles. Hearst, who was apparently elsewhere in Los Angeles at the time, stayed in hiding, moving around the country with her remaining SLA companions for another sixteen months. She was finally caught and <a id="filepos392708"></a>arrested while living in an apartment in San Francisco’s Mission District, long after Price had stopped looking for her.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ingo Swann, back in New York, had also spent some time looking for Patty Hearst, at the suggestion of former astronaut Edgar Mitchell. In the end he’d had no more luck than Price, although he claimed afterwards to have sensed that “the big action will take place in Los Angeles.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann also worked on some other, lower-profile missing person cases, but soon gave up the practice. Most, he would say later, ended with the discovery that the missing person was dead. That could be hard on him—remote viewing amplified one’s emotional sensitivity—and could be even harder on the missing person’s family, whose members typically ended up distraught and confused, unsure whether to believe the psychic’s grim news.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann sat for some parapsychological experiments, at the American Society for Psychical Research and the Maimonides Dream Laboratory, in New York, and at various other places in the psi research world. He also did some work for oil companies, helicoptering out to a rig in the Gulf of Mexico, and riding around Kentucky and Tennessee and Arkansas with a wildcatting team funded by Bill Keeler, the chairman of Phillips Petroleum. None of those relationships lasted very long, but Swann would earn enough money in this period to buy a four-story house in the Bowery section of lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann tried his hand, or mind, at global prophecy, predicting in late 1973 and again in 1974 that mainstream science would soon come to accept psychic phenomena. He also remote-viewed Mars and Jupiter and Mercury in advance of American and Russian space probes, trying to see how far out his perception could go. Some of the data were <a id="filepos394824"></a>interesting,<a id="filepos394844" href="#filepos410317">*</a> although skeptics like Carl Sagan later dismissed it all as a mixture of the predictable, the ambiguous, and—like the “lichen” Swann saw growing on the lead-melting surface of Mercury—the wildly incorrect.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of Swann’s most interesting projects was a novel, a strange half-philanthropic, half-misanthropic fantasy titled <em class="calibre4">Star Fire</em>. The main character was a youthful, handsome rock star with extraordinary psychic powers. He could remote-view anywhere in the universe, and could also remotely exert psychokinetic effects—scrambling computers and dissolving files and so forth. There was a secret arms race between the superpowers involving satellite-borne microwave death-beam weapons. A shady Dr. No-type character on some distant island also possessed one of the weapons. The rock star knew about all this, from his nightly remote viewings, and disapproved. He began to send anonymous letters to the White House and the Politburo, telling them to shut down their death-beam programs, or else. They came looking for him, so he cashed in all his millions, faked his own death, and resided in suspended animation in an obscure life-support facility. Meanwhile his consciousness roamed freely around the globe, tweaking the superpowers’ noses. In the end the superpowers didn’t accede to his demands swiftly enough, so he psychically hijacked the death-beam satellites and trained them on the countries that had built them. Goodbye, Omaha. Goodbye, Novosibirsk. Goodbye, Dr. No. The End.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Swann returned to SRI as a consultant in the autumn of 1974. Puthoff had offered him increased compensation, and relative freedom to develop further his coordinate <a id="filepos396755"></a>remote-viewing technique. His arrival also was to correspond with the departure of Pat Price.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price had no complaints about how SRI had treated him, but the fact remained that his renown had spread, and many people now regarded him not merely as a scientific curiosity, but as a sort of golden-egg-laying goose. That autumn he went to work for a coal company in Huntington, West Virginia. The company president, who wanted to take some time off, offered Price his job, a substantial salary, and shares of stock. Price’s task, besides serving as president, was to use his psi talents to find rich veins of coal in the West Virginia hills. He told Hal Puthoff that he would spend only a year or so out on the East Coast, then would return to SRI with his presumed millions—which, he said, when properly invested, would ensure that the SRI psi research program was funded forever.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">What he didn’t tell Puthoff was that he was also going to work directly for the CIA.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Norm Everheart, meanwhile, was about to enter the remote-viewing scene for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart was only forty-four, but he already had nearly a quarter century of service in the CIA behind him. In 1950, as a twenty-year-old television engineer with the military draft hanging over him, he had been recruited by the fledgling intelligence agency, and had quickly been sent to Greece. There he had been a clandestine radio operator, broadcasting propaganda to help prevent a Communist takeover of the country, living in the hills, on the run. Later he had put his technical skills to work for the Agency’s Office of Communications, and then the Technical Services Division (later the Office of Technical Service). His last posting, aptly enough, had been as the chief of OTS’s regional “tech base” in Athens.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When Everheart came home from Athens, he had a meeting with the head of OTS, a beefy CIA veteran named <a></a>John McMahon. McMahon told Everheart he was appointing him liaison to the Agency’s cryptically named “Staff D,” an office that specialized in small-scale signals-intelligence collection,<a id="filepos399264" href="#filepos410539">*</a> and often worked closely with OTS. Everheart’s job, McMahon told him, was to keep Staff D and OTS informed of what each office was doing and how they might be able to help each other.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day, in late 1974 or early 1975, Everheart received a call from a young, dark-haired OTS engineer, a man named Ken Kress. In some ways the father of America’s remote-viewing program, Kress had given SRI its first psi research contract back in 1972, and now he was Pat Price’s handler.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kress handed Everheart a document which described some of the remote-viewing experiments that had been run out at SRI. Everheart, though he later became the CIA’s chief liaison to Grill Flame, knew nothing about the subject at this point. But Kress urged him to consider whether there were any Staff D operations that might benefit from the assistance of remote viewers—in particular, Pat Price. Kress had already generated several other operational-type taskings from other offices at the Agency, but he wanted to know if Staff D was interested.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart thought about the matter for a while, and eventually came up with what seemed to be a good target. Recent intelligence had suggested that the communications office in the Chinese Embassy in a certain foreign capital was in the basement of the building. To an ordinary citizen, this piece of information would have no significance at all, but to an intelligence officer whose job was to intercept the communications of foreign adversaries, it sounded like a golden opportunity. In every other Chinese embassy, the communications office was on the top floor, the hardest for outside spies to access. A ground floor or basement target was a piece of cake by comparison. For Everheart and Staff <a></a>D, all that prevented an operation to penetrate the embassy’s communications was a confirmation that the basement was indeed the communications office. So far they had no firm confirmation. The basement had once been a wine cellar; perhaps that was all it was now. It would be a disaster if they mounted a major break-in operation only to discover that they had penetrated the wrong room.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart, after looking over some of the data Pat Price had generated, decided that if the psychic came up with a detailed description of code clerks and communications gear in the basement of the embassy in question, then the SIGINT penetration operation should proceed. He formally proposed that Price be asked to describe the embassy’s basement.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The chief of Staff D, Ed Rogers, regarded Everheart’s proposal with a good deal of skepticism. It seemed questionable enough, on operational grounds, but there were also political repercussions within the Agency to think about. Rogers could just imagine the laughter raining down on him should it become widely known that his office was consulting a psychic. Norm Everheart came to call that concern “the giggle factor.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Rogers eventually agreed to consider Price for the operation, but with a major condition. Price first had to succeed in three tests against similar targets—targets on which the Agency already had ample information.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Three paranormal tests … The idea had a strange, mythic resonance. It sounded almost like the twelve great labors of Hercules. Would Price be able to handle it? Everheart didn’t know, but in consultation with Ed Rogers, he set about assembling the three tests.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A few days later, while Price was on a visit to the Washington area, Ken Kress and another CIA officer, Nick Clancy, came to his hotel room for the first test. After some small talk, Kress opened his briefcase and pulled out a black-and-white photograph of a building somewhere in <a></a>the world. Unknown to Price, the building was the Chinese Embassy in a large city in Africa; the CIA knew the layout of the embassy down to tiny details.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price looked at the photo and then sat down at the desk in the room, took out some paper and a pen, and started sketching. He sketched a rough outline of the continent of Africa, drew a line horizontally through it, to indicate the equator, and then marked a point where he believed the building was. Clancy, whose job for the last few years had been to conduct technical penetrations of such embassies in Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East, could see that Price was dead on target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“How far is this building from the ocean?” asked Clancy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“One hundred fifty miles,” said Price, getting it right again. Then Price looked at the photograph and pointed at the building. “Wait a minute … There are <em class="calibre4">three</em> buildings at this site, not just this one.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kress and Clancy exchanged glances. Right again.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Now Price, down in his zone, went into the building depicted in the photograph. It was as if his ghost were actually in the building, walking through it, while his physical body delivered a sort of tour guide’s monologue, and sketched out the embassy’s floor plan. “Watch your step when you go down this hallway,” he told the two CIA men. “The light is bad.” And Clancy remembered that he had once gone down that very hallway, during an operation, and had almost lost his footing because of the bad light.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price’s train of thought was already jumping onto a new track. Holding the photo of the building, he turned to Clancy and said: <em class="calibre4">“You</em> developed this picture in the basement of a house about a mile down the road from this building.” Clancy had to think about it for a moment, but he soon realized that Price was absolutely right.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After the session with Price was over, Clancy went out with Kress for a drink. Multiple drinks, actually—Clancy <a></a>later described it to Norm Everheart as an “eight-martini evening.” He had been that shaken up.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">A day or so later, in the same hotel room, Pat Price faced his second test. Ken Kress and Nick Clancy handed him another black-and-white photo of a building, and Price quickly drew a map of Italy, marking Rome. Then he moved his pen down, across the Mediterranean Sea, to a North African capital. The building was in that city, he said. Right so far, thought Kress and Clancy.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After locating the building, Price walked in through its main entrance, into a large foyer. “What a magnificent staircase!” he remarked, but after gliding ethereally up its steps, he suddenly stopped. “You know, that’s the most beds I’ve seen in any one place.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kress and Clancy looked at him. <em class="calibre4">Beds?</em></p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Price was gliding through the building again. After some more description, he said, “There are a lot of people hurting in here.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Clancy realized now that something was wrong. There weren’t a lot of beds in the embassy, as far as he knew. There weren’t a lot of injured people. Price sounded as if he were describing a dormitory or a hospital, not an embassy. And when Clancy asked Price to describe his progress up to the front of the building—were there any obstructions?—Price just seemed to drift right up to the door. The large iron gate that blocked the main entrance in real life didn’t seem to exist in Price’s otherworldly tableau.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price otherwise described the layout of the embassy accurately. But Clancy was perplexed by the information he knew wasn’t true. What had Price been seeing? Clancy later did some checking, and found out that the embassy had been a girls’ school dormitory in the years just before World War II, and then had been used as a hospital during the war. Back then there had been no iron gate. Price, <a></a>without knowing it, had simply slipped through another one of his time warps.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">For the third target, a Chinese consular building in Rome, Price redeemed himself, describing the layout accurately and in present time. He even described a mural on the ceiling of one of the embassy’s more important rooms. Clancy knew only too well about the mural. Had it not been for the difficulty of concealing any holes they made in the mural—there were no Michelangelos at the CIA—he and his men would have planted bugs in that ceiling long before.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Norm Everheart eventually presented the results of these three tests to Staff D chief Ed Rogers. Everheart was confident that Price had passed the tests. Rogers, who perhaps had assumed that Price would fail miserably, seemed startled by the quality of the data. But the giggle factor still worried him; he just wasn’t ready to rely on a psychic to guide such a high-stakes break-in. “It may be the only opportunity we ever have to find something at ground level,” he told Everheart. “I’m not going to screw it up by reading tea leaves.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And that was that. The giggle factor had won out. In the end, Rogers approved a risky operation to check the targeted embassy’s basement by close-up technical means. The operation resulted in the conclusion that the Chinese Embassy’s basement was, after all, only a wine cellar.</p>
