But he continued to remote-view on occasion, informally, just to keep in psychic shape. And he maintained contact with Atwater and the others back at Fort Meade, monitoring the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As he neared the end of his tour in Germany, he decided that he wanted to become a professional remote viewer again. The program was expanding with the SRI training contract. Operational taskings were still coming in. It sounded as if good things were happening.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley applied for transfer back to the unit, and his application was accepted. In the summer of 1984, he and his wife Brigitte sold their house in Germany and packed their bags for the trip home. In five more years Riley would be eligible for retirement with full benefits. He intended to <a id="filepos698374"></a>finish those years as a remote viewer, and there seemed to be nothing to stop him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Then one day, not long before he was to leave for the United States, he received a phone call from Brian Busby at Fort Meade. Busby was apologetic but blunt. Riley’s destination, the remote-viewing unit, was about to become extinct. “Sorry, guy,” said Busby. “You’re fucked.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The crisis had been brewing since 1981, when Ed Thompson departed as the assistant chief of staff for intelligence. The ACSI was in a sense the top slot in Army intelligence, but the office then carried the same rank—major general—as the office of INSCOM commander. For Army intelligence to run smoothly, the ACSI and the INSCOM commander therefore had to get along relatively well. During Thompson’s tour as ACSI that had been the case. Thompson and the INSCOM commander, William Rolya, had seen eye to eye on most issues, including the delicate issue of the remote-viewing program.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Then in 1981 the guard changed. Thompson was replaced by William <a id="filepos699667"></a>Odom, and Rolya by Bert Stubblebine. Odom (who would go on to head the National Security Agency a few years later) emphatically did not share Stubblebine’s interest in paranormal and mystical matters, and on the whole the two men did not get along. It was clear by the middle of 1984 that Stubblebine, now derisively nicknamed “General Spoonbender,” was becoming increasingly marginalized in the running of Army intelligence. A number of INSCOM staff officers had begun, in effect, to take orders from Odom instead.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Even in the remote-viewing program, where support for Stubblebine might have been strongest, the general was thought to have gone too far in his enthusiasms. By promoting a series of questionable projects in the alternative realm, he was giving one that seemed to be worth something—remote viewing—a bad name.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos700680"></a>The general was also starting to interfere directly with the remote-viewing program. Around 1983, he befriended freelance psychic <a id="filepos700818"></a>Alex Tannous, and seemed to be thinking about giving him official psychic spying assignments, presumably on some kind of contract basis. Skip Atwater saw this and realized that it was time for damage control. On his advice, Brian Busby raised the matter with Stubblebine, respectfully making the point that Tannous should work through the Fort Meade remote-viewing unit, or should keep away from Army intelligence altogether. The unit, said Busby, would be happy to give him a tryout. Stubblebine eventually agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One evening, not long afterwards, Tannous was at a party somewhere in the D.C. area when he was informed that General Stubblebine had a car and driver waiting outside for him. He went outside, got into the car, and was taken to Fort Meade. The driver pulled up in front of two isolated wooden buildings numbered 2560 and 2561.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Inside, Tannous was met by Atwater, Busby, and several remote viewers. He was suitably impressed by the cloak-and-dagger aura of it all. He was also wearing makeup and eyeliner, and seemed to conform all too well to the stereotype of the flaky, self-absorbed psychic. He seemed to be expecting this sort of special treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After signing a nondisclosure form, Tannous was briefly told about the unit, now code-named Center Lane, and was then ushered into building 2560, into one of the RV rooms. Atwater gave him an operational target, related to a crisis then going on somewhere in the world. Tannous, instead of describing the target, began to ask questions about it. <em class="calibre4">Is it like this? Is it like that?</em> He seemed to need considerable “front-loading.” In the end he produced no information of value. The tryout was over. Stubblebine backed down.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Stubblebine still managed to handpick recruits, as long as he stayed within INSCOM’s ranks. That kind of interference was also resented by Atwater, Busby, and the <a id="filepos703002"></a>remote viewers. The program was meant to select people with reliable, well-tested psychic abilities as well as other attributes such as discipline and intelligence. Stubblebine didn’t seem as interested in those criteria when he selected people. It was hit or miss. Lyn Buchanan, though a nice enough fellow, hadn’t even been selected for his remote-viewing potential. Essentially he had been selected because Stubblebine was fascinated by spoonbending and other supposed PK manifestations, and had heard the story of the computer network crash at Augsburg—an incident that, of course, might have had a completely mundane explanation. Whether or not Buchanan had any real PK abilities, there was just no use for them in the program. Such phenomena were considered far less robust than remote viewing. Buchanan had therefore been squeezed into the role of remote viewer instead.<a id="filepos703908" href="#filepos734326">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the end, Buchanan didn’t perform badly, and he was also respected as a good monitor and a teacher of RV techniques. But a short time after he joined the unit, another Stubblebine recruit appeared on the scene—a blonde corporal from an INSCOM base in Greece, named Dawn Lutz. She was known to her friends as a palm-reader, and that seemed to have been good enough for Stubblebine to send her to Fort Meade. Unfortunately, she wasn’t interested in learning the more formal remote-viewing techniques now being used by the unit. (There was no money in the budget to send Stubblebine’s recruits to SRI, but they were expected to learn the Swann technique from others at Fort Meade who had been taught it.) Lutz, like Alex Tannous, didn’t seem able to produce good data. Feeling unwelcome, she soon transferred out of the unit.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos704965"></a>It eventually became the perception, from the remote viewers on up to senior levels in the Pentagon, that Major General Stubblebine had begun to focus too intensely on the paranormal. It was as if he had embarked on some kind of spiritual quest, and were trying to take the Army along for the ride. Nothing symbolized this more than his visits to the Monroe Institute.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Monroe Institute held its five-day Gateway Voyage/RAPT courses for INSCOM personnel every few weeks. In late 1983 and early 1984 Stubblebine managed to make his way down for most of the courses, to ride the waves of Bob Monroe’s Hemi-Sync tapes. Once or twice he stayed for the entire five days, but mostly he came down only for the final day. He was there when Ed Dames and Paul Smith and the other Swann trainees took their course in December 1983, and he was there in the spring of 1984 when Lyn Buchanan and Dawn Lutz—and Colonel John Alexander, and even Stubblebine’s own office secretary—went down for their own Hemi-Sync treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Already by the winter of 1983, in the group discussions at the course, Stubblebine was telling his INSCOM officers the following story: One day, on a walk near the Monroe buildings, down the road towards Lake Miranon, he had seen a little yellow-orange salamander cross his path. It was just a salamander, yet—it seemed significant somehow. It symbolized the … <em class="calibre4">rightness</em> … of what he, Major General Stubblebine, was doing at INSCOM, the <em class="calibre4">wisdom</em> of his alternative approach to the management of military intelligence.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Now, the perception of hypersignificance in what would otherwise seem to be a random event was a classic aspect of altered-state behavior, probably most familiar to hallucinogen users. Sometimes it was the only kind of logic one heard down at Monroe, where people spent several hours in trance each day, straining to have some kind of mystical, <a id="filepos707150"></a>transcendental experience. It seemed to some that the general was obsessed with the idea of having an OBE, and was compensating for his failure with the overblown salamander story. As such, it was all part of the Monroe experience, not to be taken too seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the story of the general and his salamander soon spread throughout INSCOM, and higher. Senior Army officials became worried about what was going on in Stubblebine’s INSCOM. General Ed Thompson and a colleague went to see Stubblebine, and expressed their concerns. It didn’t seem to make any difference. One general, a close friend of Stubblebine’s from their days at West Point, would later describe Stubblebine as having gone “overboard.” Stubblebine’s critics would also use the term “loss of perspective.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Matters were made especially bad for Stubblebine by the brewing “Yellow Fruit” scandal, in which some of IN-SCOM’s covert-action squads had used the blackness of their budgets to buy or rent expensive cars, prostitutes, and other things which were obviously not essential to their missions. Although Stubblebine was never accused of involvement, and in fact played an important part in exposing the scandal, the impression spread that INSCOM was out of control. Stubblebine’s career seemed to be teetering on the edge of a precipice.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Back in 1982 or 1983, <a id="filepos708788"></a>Richard Kennett at the CIA had been asked to consult with the Army on its involvement with the Monroe Institute. Kennett had declined any involvement, citing concerns over the “human use” implications. He believed that by promoting altered states, one made the brain more unstable, more prone to spontaneous hallucinations and delusions. He could see no reason at all why the Army should be involved with Monroe, and could see many reasons why it should not.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of Kennett’s reasons, though unstated in his com <a id="filepos709401"></a>merits to the Army, was that he had once had his own OBE, using some tips he had picked up from one of Bob Monroe’s books. He had felt himself separating from his prone, sleeping form, like a crab molting from its old shell. Then he was free. He walked across the room—but now there were other beings in the room. There were monsters. Some kind of goblin hobbled up, put its nose right in his face, stared at him. <em class="calibre4">Jesus!</em> Kennett went back over to his bed, and tried to get back inside his body. He wasn’t sure he could do it. The goblin—</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett made it back all right, but he would recommend, to anyone who asked, that out-of-body experiences be avoided like the plague. He suspected that the effects on the emotions, and on the nervous system in general, could result in heart attacks, psychological trauma, and even psychotic breaks in people who were already unstable.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett’s recommendations seemed to go unheard. Then one day in 1984, a young INSCOM lieutenant, Doug Pemberton, decided to go down to Monroe for the Gateway course. Pemberton, the son of a general, was the kind who would do two hundred push-ups before breakfast, and then would practice martial arts. In any case, he went down to the Monroe Institute on the INSCOM bus, and was assigned a Hemi-Sync cubicle. He began listening to the tapes, and sitting in on group discussion sessions. A day or so into the course, there was the perception that he was harassing one of the female trainers. The disturbance seemed to pass, but things still didn’t seem quite right with Pemberton. At one point, around the third day of the course, Pemberton and the other students were in their cubicles, drifting along on those mellifluously synthesized waves of Hemi-Sync sound. Fifteen or twenty minutes into the tape, a Monroe staffer noticed Pemberton in one of the hallways near his room. Doug Pemberton had been riding those Hemi-Sync waves all right, but had gone a bit too far with them. He was naked and incoherent. He was taken <a id="filepos711598"></a>away to a psychiatric ward at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It was revealed later that Lieutenant Pemberton (who soon recovered) had a history of psychiatric treatment that he had kept out of his Army records and had never admitted in the Monroe screening questionnaire.<a id="filepos711951" href="#filepos734694">*</a> Had this been known, it was said, Pemberton would never have been allowed into the Gateway course in the first place. But it was too late. The toothpaste was forever out of the tube. After William Odom, the ACSI, began to use the incident against Stubblebine at high levels, the INSCOM commander “fell on his sword,” in a colleague’s words, and resigned. He would later become an executive at the BDM Corporation, a defense contractor in suburban Virginia.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Stubblebine’s replacement was Major General Harry Soyster, sent by higher-ups at the Pentagon to clean house at INSCOM. Like Odom, Soyster took a relatively dim view of the paranormal. But even before Soyster arrived at INSCOM, it was clear that Stubblebine’s apparent excesses, and the growing opposition from Odom, spelled the end of the alternative, fringeish programs in the Army. Without support from somewhere else, the Fort Meade remote-viewing unit was doomed.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">One day in 1984, around the time that Stubblebine’s demise was becoming inevitable, Richard Kennett was asked to attend a briefing on the remote-viewing program. The briefing was primarily for CIA director William Casey and his top deputies; but as a senior analyst who had been read onto the program years before, and had written a number <a></a>of reports and recommendations on it, Kennett was invited as well.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett now was only a year away from leaving the Agency for a job in private industry; meanwhile he was preoccupied with relatively mundane matters, especially the development of chemical and biological weapons by the Soviet Union and some of its client states and allies. His involvement with Pat Price and others at SRI was a distant memory. But he was anxious to see how the program had progressed under the DIA’s and the Army’s sponsorship.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Others were less anxious. Robert Gates, now the head of the Directorate of Intelligence, walked out of the room in disgust when he heard what the briefing was about. He simply refused to take any remote-viewing stories seriously. In any case, he had enough controversy on his hands already; the CIA was just then running a small war in Central America, funneling arms to the Nicaraguan contras and harassing the Sandinistas, and trying to keep Congress from shutting the whole operation down.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The briefing on the remote-viewing program was run by Jack Vorona from the DIA. He discussed the history of the program and some examples of recent operational and experimental sessions. Ostensibly, the briefing was meant to keep Casey and his top officials informed of what was going on.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But imparting information wasn’t the only point of the briefing. Vorona was apparently also hoping for some support from the CIA. If only he could get a senior official from the Agency, someone at Gates’s level, or even a rung lower, to say a few kind words about the program to the intelligence committees on Capitol Hill. A few kind words to keep the budget flowing. The supporters of the program in the DIA knew that John McMahon, at least privately, was still relatively enthusiastic about remote viewing. But McMahon, now at a fairly lofty stage in his career, had <a id="filepos715643"></a>begun to seem more worried about the “giggle factor,” and had been distancing himself from the program.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMahon’s boss, Casey, was more daring; in fact, he was one of the most politically fearless directors the Agency had ever seen. As nominal head of the U.S. intelligence community, he probably could have killed the remote-viewing program if he had wanted to, but he didn’t. If anything, he seemed impressed and interested with what Vorona presented. He asked to be kept posted on further developments. Still, Casey reacted that way to a lot of things, and nothing really came of the briefing. Richard Kennett had the impression that no one at the Agency—no one the intelligence committees would take seriously—was about to stick his neck out for the RV program.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett himself was disappointed by the briefing. The remote-viewing data he saw on Vorona’s viewgraphs seemed to him like the same material he had seen ten years earlier. The remote viewers, for all their vaunted training at SRI, didn’t seem to be getting any better. And still no one had figured out a way to tell when a remote viewer was <em class="calibre4">on</em>, as opposed to when he was off. The only way was to try to verify the information with other sources, but as Kennett saw it, the psi information wasn’t consistently accurate or detailed enough in the first place to justify that kind of diversion of intelligence resources. Some of the data remote viewers provided were amazingly good, but other data were embarrassingly bad. (Kennett might not have known it, but around this time, one of the remote viewers out at SRI had spontaneously “foreseen” a deadly terrorist attack on Washington, D.C. The plot involved a vehicle with a nuclear device parked outside the U.S. Capitol on the night President Reagan was to give his annual State of the Union address. The FBI had been alerted, but no such vehicle had been found and no bomb had gone off. The entire thing had been an “Aol.”)</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Seeing that nothing much had changed in ten years, <a id="filepos717958"></a>Kennett was convinced that remote viewing’s signal-to-noise ratio was just too low. There was no way, in his opinion, that it was ready to become a regular, everyday intelligence-gathering technology. The term <em class="calibre4">PSI-INT</em> would probably have to wait until the next millennium.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">It looked as if Ed Dames’s heroic journey to Jedi knighthood had hit a dead end. He was sent back to his old office at SED. Bill Ray and Paul Smith and Charlene Cavanaugh went into similar holding patterns. Others already at the remote-viewing unit began thinking about where else they might like to go.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The remote-viewing program nevertheless managed to survive. Jack Vorona, the super god in the sky, somehow worked it out with his budgeters and his friends in Congress, and arranged for a transfer of the men and women of the Fort Meade unit to his Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate at the DIA. The plan was that the unit would stay in its old offices at Fort Meade. When Army funding ran out, at the end of 1985, DIA funding would begin. In the meantime the unit would be in a kind of limbo; there would be no operations, only day after day of training. Lieutenant Colonel Brian Busby left for another post, and Bill Ray, now a major, was appointed as the unit’s temporary commander.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Morale in the unit declined rapidly, and by the end of 1985 Tom Nance was gone. Nance had been something of a legend for the cool, technical perfection of his CRV sessions. He had been the living embodiment of the Swannian principles of remote viewing. He hadn’t been perfect; he had had his bad days, and the rigid structure of his CRV technique had often prevented him from really getting to the heart of his targets. But he had been the best of the unit’s second generation, and his departure was seen as a further blow to the program. He left, he said, to get back to ordinary life. His marriage and his Army career had suffered <a id="filepos720134"></a>from his remote-viewing work. He took a post somewhere overseas.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Shortly after Nance left, one of the remote viewers in the unit wrote up a series of memoranda, making light of the unit’s predicament, and the hostility that continued to be directed at it by General Odom. One read:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<p class="calibre_25"><span><span class="calibre13">THE CONTINUING SAGA OF THE PSI-FORCE 5</span></span><br class="calibre7"/>This week’s thriller:<br class="calibre7"/>IMPENDING ODOOM</p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">As we rejoin our heroes, we find that disaster has taken its toll among the ranks of the Psi-Force 5.

<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">As our story opens, Bill, the fast-talking, take-charge commander of <em class="calibre4">The Force</em>, is briefing the crew on the training schedule:</p></blockquote>

Like my idol, General Custer, used to say, ‘Proper training and good leadership! That’s what wins battles!’ ” …</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">The SRI program ended up faring better. During 1984 and into 1985, Vorona and Hal Puthoff lobbied Congress and various military and civilian intelligence offices for funding, while continuing to take occasional operational tasks to the remaining SRI viewers. Briefings and remote-viewing demonstrations were held for members of Congress, the White House, the Navy, the Air Force, the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard, the <a id="filepos722478"></a>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and various Pentagon task forces concerned with drug interdiction. Even President Reagan’s science adviser, George Keyworth, received a briefing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eventually SRI won key support from one of these agencies—a Pentagon-affiliated agency which no one wants to identify—and a five-year, $10 million R&amp;D contract was arranged, one of its purposes being the investigation of the neurophysiology of remote viewing and other forms of psi. An enviable assortment of scientific and medical review panels was set up. Hal Puthoff was satisfied that the SRI program would be safe for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Especially now, in the post-Stubblebine climate, Puthoff knew he had to be very guarded in his enthusiasm for remote viewing when he spoke before congressmen or intelligence officials. But in private he seemed extraordinarily confident about the technique’s potential. Since the mid and late 1970s he had been using remote viewing on jaunts to Las Vegas. He and his wife and friends would sit in their hotel room before going down to the casino. The plan was that they would go into the casino at a certain time, would walk over to one of the roulette wheels, and would start to bet immediately after the roulette ball landed on one of the green 00 markers. Up in the room beforehand, they would try to guess—precognitively—on the results of a stretch of, say, ten roulette spins following the 00, using a combined-result error-correcting technique like the one Charles Tart had used in the shell-game study. When Puthoff was satisfied that their guesses had converged on a particular sequence of blacks and reds, the party would go down to the casino, wait for the 00 signal, and place their bets. On many of these occasions, he said later, he and his friends won back the cost of their trip, and then some.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Towards the mid-1980s, Puthoff and his wife, Adrienne, became involved with the founding of a new private school in the Menlo Park area. A key investor backed out at the <a id="filepos724751"></a>last minute, and the board was faced with a twenty-five-thousand-dollar shortfall, several weeks before the school year began. With nothing else left to do but fold the school and send teachers and students elsewhere, Puthoff proposed a variant of Targ and Harary’s silver-futures scheme. The board warily backed the idea. Puthoff and his wife soon assembled a small team of board members and quickly trained them in associative remote viewing. On each day of silver-futures trading, they tried to view precognitively an unspecified object they would be shown the following day. Puthoff, running the operation, secretly selected two objects—say, a hat and a bicycle—one of which signified “market up,” the other “market down.” If the responses from the viewers were reasonably unambiguous on any given day, Puthoff would direct his broker to make a trade, buying or selling as appropriate. Unlike Targ and Harary’s story, this one had a happy ending. After a month, these first-time remote viewers had made the twenty-five thousand dollars they needed. The school was saved.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Puthoff’s career was about to swerve onto a new track.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff knew that funding for SRI’s remote-viewing research would continue until the end of the decade. But he could see the clouds that were building over the program, and he was beginning to grow bored with the management of it all. To add to his headaches, there were the internal politics at SRI, which seemed only to have gotten worse after the departure of Targ and Harary. Jim Salyer was starting to micromanage the program, and seemed to be playing favorites with certain remote viewers. He and Puthoff were increasingly at odds.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">While all this was pressing in on him, Puthoff suddenly saw an opportunity elsewhere, an opportunity of suitable grandness for a man so used to working on the secret edge of things.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos726971"></a>Since the early 1970s Puthoff had served as a part-time paid consultant to Bill Church, his philanthropist friend from Texas. Church, who had then been bothered by OPEC’s stranglehold on world oil, wanted advice on alternative energy sources. Puthoff hadn’t spent a lot of time researching the problem, but from the early 1980s he had become increasingly interested in a phenomenon known as “zero-point energy,” or “vacuum energy,” a background field of electromagnetic energy throughout the universe (which was different from, and much stronger than, the cosmic microwave background from the Big Bang). Though postulated for decades by quantum physicists, zero-point energy had generally been considered too obscure and difficult a subject for deep exploration. Puthoff nevertheless believed that he could conceivably tap into this energy, thus providing a truly ultimate power source, better even than nuclear fusion.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At Puthoff’s urging, Church started a small company to try to develop zero-point-energy-tapping technology. By the late autumn of 1984, Puthoff was encouraged enough by preliminary engineering work that he made the decision to join the venture, Jupiter Technologies, full-time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For months, while SRI’s big remote-viewing contract was being negotiated through the DIA, Puthoff told no one of his decision to leave, for fear of jeopardizing the deal. Then, in the early summer of 1985, on the day the contract came through, he suddenly announced his resignation. Two weeks later, he was gone.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Joe McMoneagle had retired from the Army in September 1984. He had been in “retirement mode,” as it was called, for a while, and his life had been changing. His second wife, Peggy, had become increasingly annoyed by his long hours at the RV unit, and by his long trips to SRI and the Monroe Institute. Joe and Peggy had grown apart, and then had separated, and then had agreed to divorce.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>Throughout this time the Monroe Institute had become a kind of second home for McMoneagle. He loved working at the institute, with Bob Monroe and his staff; the atmosphere there was much more congenial than at Fort Meade. McMoneagle also had fallen in love with one of Bob Monroe’s stepdaughters, Nancy Honeycutt, and hoped to marry her.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Aside from all that, there was something about the central Virginia hills that attracted McMoneagle. He had gone there to calm his soul after returning from Vietnam a decade and a half before. Now he went to those hills to get away from the bustle and clutter of the Washington, D.C., area. The city had been getting on his nerves. He suspected that years of remote viewing had left him too open to other people’s mental noise. Up in the glorious hills, there was a lot less of that.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For the last year or so of his work at Fort Meade, McMoneagle spent his weekends down at Monroe, commuting up to Washington on Mondays and back on Fridays. After he retired, he and Nancy built a house near the institute. He signed on at SRI as a consultant, and did research and occasional operational work with Ed May, who was running the program after Puthoff’s departure. Joe and Nancy also started their own company, Intuitive Intelligence Applications, catering to police departments or intelligence agencies or just ordinary people who felt they needed psychic assistance. He did a lot of work over the fax machine. A client could put a target in an envelope and place it on a desk in California, and McMoneagle could remote-view it, no problem, from his house in the hills three thousand miles away. His remote-viewing skills seemed undiminished despite all the years, and although he was disappointed at the way things had turned out at Fort Meade, he didn’t feel burned out. He felt that he still had a lot of remote viewing left in him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As McMoneagle knew, some of the others associated <a></a>with the program hadn’t fared so well. In fact it was a bit unsettling that so many of them had seemed to die before their time. Had they been living too far out on the shamanic edge of things? Did the act of remote viewing, or even being near a remote viewer, produce some kind of hazardous effect on the human nervous system, or the immune system? McMoneagle didn’t know, but the numbers seemed too high to ignore. There were Pat Price and Jackie Keith, who both had died of <a id="filepos731905"></a>heart attacks. (Alex Tannous would later die of a heart attack too.) Rob Cowart and Hartleigh Trent had developed serious cases of cancer; Cowart had been severely disabled and Trent had died. Cancer was currently gnawing at Jim Salyer and Hella Hammid, neither of whom would live through the decade. Even the lab secretary at SRI, young and attractive Martha Thompson, was about to die from melanoma. The thought crossed McMoneagle’s mind more than once—when am I going to go? Still, with his near-death experience in Europe and all the altered-state adventures since then, he had become convinced that beyond death was just another phase of existence. He had been there and done that, or at any rate closely enough not to be too afraid anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One afternoon in June 1985, around the time that Puthoff abruptly departed SRI, McMoneagle and Nancy Honeycutt went out on Lake Miranon, in the small hollow below the Monroe Institute. There was a raft out in the middle of the lake, and they rowed a boat out to it and put down their towels and a jug of iced tea. They were lying on the raft, floating in Monroe heaven there in the Blue Ridge Mountains, when Joe felt a dull pain in his upper abdomen, as if someone had kicked him. Nancy rowed him back to shore, and drove him to the nearest hospital. As they pulled up in front of the emergency room, McMoneagle passed out. The doctors tried to stabilize him with various drugs—he was having a massive heart attack—and he drifted in and out of consciousness, in and out of exotic, <a></a>alternate realities. After a week down in these shifting zones, he was sent by ambulance to a larger hospital at Charlottesville for emergency triple-bypass surgery. The doctors sawed open his rib cage, and put him on a heart-lung machine, and he watched them do it, hovering near the ceiling. Then he drifted somewhere else, somewhere that was better.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When he finally awoke, after the surgery, he had a breathing tube down his throat. He motioned to a nurse to bring him a pen and paper. The stuff he had seen—the light … the strange, godlike entities—somehow he had to get it all written down.</p>
