<p class="calibre_33"><a href="index_split_017.html#filepos237759">10</a>  May 29: The account of the SRI side of this event comes from Puthoff and Puthoff and Targ (1973, 1975, 1977), who omit mention of the actual target. The anecdote about Price and the police dispatcher comes from Targ 1996. The account of the CIA side comes from a former senior CIA official. (The official told me that “Bill O’Donnell” was not involved in evaluating psi research, and initially didn’t know why “Kennett” had asked him for coordinates. Puthoff, however, remembered that O’Donnell later visited SRI with Kennett, and he understood that O’Donnell also was involved in the psi research evaluation.)<br class="calibre7"/>The results of the remote-viewing sessions were published in SRI’s reports to the CIA (Puthoff and Targ 1973, 1975), which were only recently declassified. The target site, the Naval Security Group Activity base at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, has never been officially confirmed, though I was able to match it to the RV descriptions. After identifying Sugar Grove as the target site in Schnabel and Eagles 1995, I then <a></a>obtained confirmation from several sources formerly associated with the remote-viewing program.<br class="calibre7"/>There are some oddities about this case. For one, I was unable to find any record of the personnel named by Price—Hamilton, Nash, and Calhoun—in the Army, Air Force, or Marines (the ranks imply that they were not Navy). Moreover, the actual coordinates given to Swann and Price described a place about ten miles to the southwest of Sugar Grove, on Bullpasture Mountain, in Virginia. Swann claimed to me that the names, the project code words, and the coordinates indicated by Price were later <em class="calibre4">changed</em> in SRI’s reports of the incident, to protect the security of the target. But Puthoff denies this and says he doesn’t even remember checking the accuracy of the coordinates.</p>
