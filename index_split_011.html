HUMINT was traditional human intelligence, provided by foreign agents and their case officers; it was, so the joke went, the “second-oldest profession.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Then there was PHOTINT, photographic intelligence, which usually referred to satellite or spy-plane imagery, and was also sometimes called IMINT. The pictures U.S. intelligence could take from its spies in the skies included visible-light images, thermal infrared images, gamma-ray images, even wall- and ground-penetrating radar images.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">SIGINT, signals intelligence, covered intercepts of virtually all electronic signals, while COMINT, communications intelligence, generally referred to signals from a telephone or a radio conversation. SIGINT/COMINT was rapidly becoming <a id="filepos74225"></a>the most important intelligence-gathering technology. Led by the National Security Agency, whose staff was double that of the CIA, America’s wiretappers, eavesdroppers, and code breakers gathered enormous quantities of sensitive data, including the most private and embarrassing moments in the lives of various foreign leaders. Trying to process it all was like drinking from a fire hose, and the NSA had to rely heavily on computers to automatically sift through intercepts for worthwhile material.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Finally, there was ELINT, electronic intelligence, a category whose boundaries often blurred with those of SIGINT, COMINT, and PHOTINT. Electronic intelligence usually referred to such things as the radar signatures of enemy air defense systems, and telemetry signals for missiles and satellites.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Together these four “conventional” INTs covered the world pretty well, and probably to a much more dramatic extent than the average citizen imagined. Even so, Atwater knew that intelligence consumers preferred not to rely on solitary sources of information. INTs were used together, to confirm and complement each other. One INT might only provide a tip in one direction, which could then be followed up by other INTs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To the Grill Flame way of thinking, there was little reason not to consider PSI-INT too—psi-derived intelligence—as long as it provided accurate data from time to time. In straight espionage terms, there seemed little to lose, and much to gain. In the late 1970s, the traditional mainstay of spy work, the human intelligence that could penetrate to the heart of an enemy’s capabilities and intentions, seemed to be on the wane. Following a number of scandals in the mid-1970s, including revelations of domestic spying, the CIA had come under unprecedented and often hostile scrutiny from Congress; thanks to that scrutiny, it was now increasingly reluctant to undertake sensitive HUMINT operations. Admiral Stansfield Turner, the <a></a>CIA’s director during the Carter presidency, seemed to prefer arm’s-length collection techniques, like satellite photography and communications intercepts. He was widely disliked at the Agency for having fired, abruptly in October 1977, two hundred case officers in CIA stations around the world. Given these cuts in America’s HUMINT capability, and the new political context in which “clean” spying methods were favored, the concept of PSI-INT seemed ideal.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Riley and the other remote viewers had little access to the goings-on at higher levels; even so, they sensed that things were changing for the better, and their morale was rising. It seemed that they really were on the secret, cutting edge of something that would someday be very big—not just in military terms, but in the way human beings understood themselves and their universe. Riley and Atwater and the others would often <a id="filepos77443"></a>broach these matters during quiet moments at the unit. They would talk about the history of psychic phenomena, and the possible explanations for it all, and where the pitfalls and limits might lie. Ken Bell, for example, believed that psi could never be used to make money; he had read too many stories about psychics who had become failures as soon as they tried to strike it rich. There was something about psi, he believed, that was intimately connected to human morality. Not everyone went along with Bell’s theorem, but most agreed that modern science, with its denial of psi, was due for some profound changes.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In most outward respects, the unit looked like any other. Its members were concerned about promotions, and benefits, and military housing, and the eventual golden light of retirement with a pension. Even the office itself, except for McMoneagle’s deep-space mural, seemed stereotypically ordinary, down to the little container of non-dairy-creamer powder next to the coffeepot, and the provocatively tight <a></a>outfits worn by the typist, a young civilian named Jenny Davenport.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Still, the exotic beliefs the remote viewers held, and the fact that they were valued more for their innate abilities than for their education or military experience, fostered a more laid-back version of military culture, in which there was hardly ever any reference to rank. Sergeant Riley was just Mel. Lieutenant Atwater was “Skip,” or “Fred.” Remote viewers generally wore casual civilian clothes, and some didn’t even wear shoes inside the office. The only discordant note was sounded by Major Watt, who hadn’t chosen to be in the unit, wasn’t particularly interested in the paranormal, and had an old-fashioned officer’s brusqueness around enlisted personnel. He rubbed Riley the wrong way from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley also found that the unit’s laid-back, psi-oriented culture didn’t always travel well, especially when it came to the home front. As career intelligence officers, dealing with classified information every day, Riley and the others had become used to keeping their work bottled up at the office. But some now found themselves unable even to tell their spouses in general terms what they did for the Army. It would have sounded too bizarre. <em class="calibre4">Honey, I lie on my back in a dark room, trying to use psychic powers to spy on people and places in foreign countries</em>. Better just to say that it was a new and interesting project, and highly classified. Parties and barbecues in which members of the unit mingled with their families were also problematic. When they occurred, the conversations tended to steer clear of the paranormal. Riley might talk about Wisconsin Indian tribes, or the beers of Germany; McMoneagle about camping, or Vietnam; Hartleigh <a id="filepos80525"></a>Trent might talk about his cabin cruiser, and going fishing out on the Bay.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Trent, in fact, was one of the great characters in the unit, and Riley and McMoneagle became his close friends. He told a good story, but he never had to pull anyone’s leg, for <a id="filepos80865"></a>he’d had a long and interesting career. In his last years in the Navy he had helped to run a cold-weather survival school up in Maine, teaching Special Forces SEALs to build igloos in the snow and so forth. A restless tinkerer and inventor, Trent had built a large solar-powered hot-water heater at his house; it worked so well, one day when he showed it off to McMoneagle, that it started to melt some of its own copper pipes.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As near as Riley could tell, Trent had not told his wife about his part-time work as a military psychic. Trent apparently was also concerned about his mother, who was said to be religiously opposed to any dabbling in the paranormal. Riley could sympathize with his colleague. For a long time he wouldn’t tell his own wife, Brigitte; all she knew was that he worked at a secret job somewhere, and didn’t have to wear his uniform. In fact, since meeting her at the start of his Wiesbaden tour in 1970, Riley had told her very little of what he did for a living. Unsurprisingly, they had been drifting apart. Riley didn’t know what the exact statistics were for marriages in which one partner worked in military intelligence, but he doubted that they were very hopeful.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Scotty Watt and Skip Atwater could work interchangeably if necessary, but they generally divided their responsibilities. Watt handled the bureaucratic end, and kept in touch with the network of Grill Flame customers. Atwater shaped incoming taskings into remote-viewing strategies, decided who would serve as monitor and viewer, and presented the final product. Along the way, he might deal with officials from other agencies, but usually only to make sure that the remote viewers were providing what was needed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ordinarily the first session for a remote viewer on a given target would be “blind”; in other words, the viewer would know only that there was a target—say, a “location,” or an “event”—out there somewhere. Not only did this <a></a>strange protocol work surprisingly well, but it was inherently self-correcting. If the target was, say, a tank factory in Minsk, and the viewer began to describe a South Pacific lagoon, his monitor would know that the viewer’s psychic aim was wide of the mark. But if the viewer began to describe a large industrial facility with Russian-speaking workers, the monitor would be fairly certain that the remote viewer had begun to “access” the target—had tuned in—and might then allow him, before subsequent sessions, to have a look at some of the target material. Thus the monitor would be able to ask increasingly specific questions about the target. “Okay, Mel, you’re on target so far. Here’s a satellite photograph of the facility you’ve been describing. Now, you see that building right there? I want you to focus on that from now on. Tell me what’s inside it.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Or the monitor might suggest a different approach to the target: “Mel, there is a man named Andrei Semyatin who works somewhere on the complex shown here in this photograph. Try to describe his surroundings at this moment.” At times, thanks to the scarcity of personnel in the unit, Riley would come in early in the morning, would serve as the remote viewer in an initial session against a target, and then for the rest of the day (before he received feedback on his session) would serve as a monitor for other viewers on the same operation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the realm of scientific experiment, these wouldn’t have been considered very rigorous protocols. To give the remote viewer any information about the target, while he was still attempting to remote-view it, would automatically cast doubt in a scientist’s mind about the validity of the resulting data. And even if the remote viewer knew nothing about the target in advance, the monitor often knew, and could inadvertently coach the viewer toward the target through his questions and reactions. To do the process with proper scientific controls would mean keeping both the <a id="filepos85341"></a>RVer and the monitor blind to the target at all times during the operation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the thing was, when it came to operations, remote viewers didn’t <em class="calibre4">have</em> to be very scientific. Scotty Watt would lose his temper more than once about what he saw as lax protocols and the need to avoid the appearance of cheating. Still, the clients weren’t so much interested in the rigor of the process as they were in the accuracy and reliability—and above all, the usefulness—of the results. That left Atwater relatively free to try whatever worked best.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of the things Atwater discovered, in the course of early experiments and operations, was that certain viewers had specific and often <a id="filepos86202"></a>unique talents when it came to psychic perception. They were the kinds of talents one might imagine in comic book superheroes. Ken Bell, for example, had an extraordinary ability to “connect” with human targets, especially distressed or missing ones, determining such things as their concerns and intents, and whatever injuries they might have.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Mel Riley was valued for his artistic skill; Atwater knew that if Riley saw something in his mind’s eye, he could render it on paper in sharp detail. Hartleigh Trent, for his part, was unusually good at taking directions at a target, in situations where other viewers might drift away in confusion. One time Atwater had Trent at a site in the Soviet Union. “I’m here, and there’s a building over there,” reported Trent. “What do you see to your right?” asked Atwater.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“I see a building, a metal building.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Okay. What do you see to the left?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“I see an open space, like a parking lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“And what do you see straight in front of you?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Trent paused for a few seconds, getting his bearings, then said, “A transmission. I’m lying under a truck.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Joe McMoneagle was probably the best at picking up and sketching the details of technological targets. But he <a id="filepos88051"></a>had far stranger talents, perhaps appropriately for a viewer whose zone was down on the very edge of dreams. In his hypnotic visions, the burly warrant officer seldom failed to see a green haze around any kind of radioactive or fissionable material. Whether it had something to do with the esoteric properties of matter and the universe, as McMoneagle himself believed, or whether it was that McMoneagle had simply read too many Superman cartoons as a kid (where deadly Kryptonite gave off the same greenish glow), the others thought it was a hell of a useful talent to have. McMoneagle sometimes also perceived radio frequency radiation—for example, from a broadcasting antenna—as a kind of orange flame.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Skeptics about psi often complained that if such a power really existed, its possessors would soon become so rich and influential that they would rule the world. But as Atwater and Riley and the others saw it, psi wasn’t as powerful as all that. Like any other human faculty, it had a host of limitations. Numbers and letters—for example, a future lottery number or a name on a secret document—were nearly impossible to remote-view accurately. Researchers out at SRI believed this had something to do, unavoidably, with the way psi data were processed in the brain.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By contrast, visually dramatic targets whose locations were fixed and long established were usually the easiest to remote-view. The problem was, however, that in the intelligence world, these kinds of targets were also relatively easy to spy on by other, more conventional means—especially satellite imagery and communications intercepts. Even if it seemed that a remote viewer had penetrated a target more thoroughly than satellite systems and listening posts had, his data might be inherently difficult to verify. But RV data <em class="calibre4">had</em> to be verified somehow by other means, for it was of controversial value at the best of times; almost no one in <a id="filepos90168"></a>the intelligence community would ever dare rely on it alone.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Despite this apparent quandary, the remote-viewing unit had regular customers, and <a id="filepos90392"></a>kept busy most of the time. A surprising number of senior officials and analysts, scattered throughout the Pentagon and CIA bureaucracies, found it reassuring to have access to remote-viewing data, especially if it matched what they expected to find at a given site. There were cases when RV data on a site were actually used to guide subsequent penetrations of the site by other means. Riley, McMoneagle, and the others were asked by the CIA, Army special-ops teams, and even the Pentagon’s Delta Force commando unit, to map the interiors of a number of foreign embassies and other sites around the world. The RV-derived maps were compared with what was already known about the buildings’ interiors. In the cases where they seemed reasonably accurate, the maps were used to guide teams that then broke into the buildings to plant listening devices or to steal information, or to do whatever it was they were supposed to do.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ironically, the taskings for which remote viewers could have been most useful were also the most difficult for them, and the most dreaded; they came to be known as “<a id="filepos91583"></a>search problems,” because the target was something, or someone, at an unknown location, and the task was to search for and find the location.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Under certain circumstances, search problems could be solved relatively quickly, for example if the search was focussed on a limited area. In one case in 1980, a target was brought in by one of the Grill Flame liaison officers from the National Security Agency. The NSA man brought a photograph of the outside of a <a id="filepos92127"></a>U.S. consulate in the Mediterranean area. He explained that information seemed to be leaking out of the consulate to the Soviets. The NSA wanted to know how.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After an initial round of relatively “blind” remote-viewing <a id="filepos92439"></a>sessions, followed by consultations with the NSA man, Atwater determined that Joe McMoneagle’s information seemed most on target. He now showed McMoneagle the photo of the consulate and asked him to go inside. McMoneagle described and mapped out a particular area of the consulate; he said he saw a flamelike emanation, some kind of unusual electromagnetic signal, coming from a wall in a certain hallway, behind a water cooler. Atwater passed the session data to the NSA man, who nodded and said he wanted to know more; he wanted to know where the bug was sending its information.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">So McMoneagle was sent back down into his zone, and Atwater asked him to scan the area around the consulate. The remote viewer soon found an apartment across the street that had its own unusual haze of electromagnetic emanations; it was the Soviet listening post, electronically tuning in to the radio signals from the bug in the consulate. But there was something else, McMoneagle said. Downstairs from the listening post, there was another apartment with strange emanations; there were Americans here.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The NSA man had to shake his head at that one. In the day or so since he had tasked the remote viewers, a special NSA investigation team at the consulate had discovered the Soviet listening post. It turned out the Soviets’ receiving equipment was so badly designed that it inadvertently re-broadcast the signals it was pulling from the bug in the consulate. The Americans that McMoneagle detected in the lower apartment were the members of the NSA team, busy eavesdropping on the eavesdroppers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It had been an impressive display of remote-viewing talent, but searches that were not so concentrated presented a much greater problem. Remote viewers often speculated about the reasons. Most seemed to believe that the longer a target had existed at a given site, the easier it was to remote-view. By contrast, the more a target moved around, the more it blurred on the screen of the RVer’s perception. <a></a>And even when it seemed that the target itself—say, a missing person—could be perceived, remote viewers often found it impossible to describe the target’s surroundings in enough detail to pinpoint the location. Sometimes McMoneagle or Bell would pick up words that seemed related to nearby towns or villages, but this tended to happen spontaneously and not always accurately. They were usually unable to move their perceptions around deliberately, to look at, say, the street signs at the nearest intersection. Even if they could, they probably wouldn’t be able to read the signs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When nothing else was working, the remote viewers might go over maps of the search area, moving their hands across it until some internal impulse told them they had hit the spot. Such “map-dowsing” techniques were never very reliable. But there were certainly some interesting search problems. One day in about 1979, a tasking that seemed particularly urgent came in. The target was an object that had been lost somewhere in the Mediterranean area; the remote viewers’ job was to find it. As they began to run sessions, it became clear what the target was. McMoneagle sensed a green glow around it. The target was <a id="filepos95993"></a>a nuclear weapon. The remote viewers’ data suggested that it had accidentally dropped off a U.S. bomber’s wing pod, into the sea near Spain, presumably during an official NATO exercise. Were the remote viewers right? They were never told.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In another case, around the same time, the unit was asked to predict the crash zone of <a id="filepos96413"></a>Skylab, which had been decaying in its orbit and was expected to reenter Earth’s atmosphere sometime in July 1979. At least half a dozen remote viewers attacked the problem. McMoneagle suggested that the big space station would impact in the South Pacific, somewhere around Australia and Indonesia. He was pretty close. A few weeks later, Skylab reentered over eastern Australia, blazed a trail westward in the sky across the <a id="filepos96854"></a>big island, and rained hot metal debris on western Australia and the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One morning, around the time of the Skylab job, a tasking came in from the Pentagon via General Thompson’s aide, Major Stone. Atwater was told simply that a <a id="filepos97181"></a>Navy A-6 attack aircraft had been lost somewhere in the world. Could the Fort Meade remote viewers find it?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ken Bell was sent against the target and was soon describing a wooded area, trees and bushes, and the charred remains of plane and crew. He felt that it was somewhere relatively close to where he was sitting at Fort Meade, certainly within a few hundred miles. He was unable to find the location on maps and had the impression that the wreckage was mostly obscured by terrain and foliage. But several times in the session, he found himself picking up the word “bald.” He didn’t know what it meant. Later, Atwater found out that the aircraft, whose terrain-following radar apparently had malfunctioned, had crashed into the side of a hill in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The name of the hill was “Bald Knob.”</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Another search problem involved a U.S. helicopter that had gone down, for some reason, in a remote corner of Peru. A Pentagon satellite had picked up what seemed to be the copter’s locator beacon, but the signal had died before anyone could triangulate in on it. On short notice, the RV unit at Fort Meade was asked to try to locate the downed craft. Atwater turned again to Ken Bell, who lay down on the leather couch in one of the RV rooms, and closed his eyes. The golden orb in his mind began to spin, and now Bell was high in the Andes, at the wreckage site. There was the pilot, and the copilot; he was with them—Suddenly, Bell was sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater soon understood what was happening. Bell was tightly wound at the best of times, but now under trance conditions, with many of the normal inhibitory mechanisms <a id="filepos99107"></a>of consciousness inoperative, he had become explosively sensitive to emotions evoked by the target. The helicopter’s pilot and copilot were not only dead; they were broken and roasted. The horror of the scene had risen up and washed over him like a wave. It was too much; Atwater had to stop the session.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Other human targets were easier to deal with. One day a CIA official brought in a classic human-intelligence problem, one that case officers had to deal with all the time. The problem was this: The Agency had an agent on its payroll in a certain East European country. Like most important agents, he was subjected every year or so to a polygraph examination to check his truthfulness. His annual “poly” was coming up, but before that happened, the agent’s case officer wanted to know what questions the Agency’s polygrapher should ask. The target package, for Atwater, consisted simply of the case officer’s name, and a date and time. The CIA official who had brought in the tasking wanted the remote viewers to spy on the case officer at that date and time, knowing that he would then be meeting with his agent. Setting it up this way, the Agency cleverly managed to target the agent without revealing that it had done so.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle, given the target by Atwater, seemed to access it fairly quickly. He described two men meeting in a restaurant. He described a briefcase that one man—the agent—had with him. What’s in the briefcase? Atwater asked McMoneagle. A lot of money, replied McMoneagle, who suggested that there were certain irregularities in the man’s financial situation that the other man—the case officer—didn’t know about. The session results were eventually cabled to the case officer overseas, and were also shown to the Agency’s designated polygrapher. A week or so later, in a safe house or hotel room somewhere in Europe, the polygrapher met secretly with the agent for the examina <a id="filepos101261"></a>tion. He began to grill him about possible financial irregularities. The agent denied everything. Then the polygrapher said, “What about all the money you had in that briefcase last week?” At this, the agent nearly fell out of his chair in astonishment. “How could you have known that?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For the CIA and some other clients, it seemed, the more oblique forms of targeting were not just good for operational security; they helped build confidence in what the remote viewers were saying. If the tasking didn’t actually specify the information that was desired, but the remote viewers provided the information anyway, the client could be more sure they hadn’t simply given him an educated guess.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day in 1980, a CIA technical operations specialist named Norm Everheart brought a photograph to Fort Meade. The photograph depicted a foreign-looking man, somewhere in his mid-forties. He was the target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Unknown to Atwater and the remote viewers, a similar photograph had landed on the desk of a government official somewhere in Scandinavia, a few weeks before, when the man in the photo had applied for a passport. He had appeared to be a local citizen. However, by a remarkable coincidence, a Western intelligence service had at the same time sent a warning to that same Scandinavian government, to the effect that the man was a KGB “illegal,” a deep-cover officer who had assumed a foreign identity. The warning, with a photograph, had landed on the desk of the same official who had received the man’s passport application.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The man was given a passport, and soon travelled to South Africa. But he did not travel alone; he was closely followed by a team of CIA and Scandinavian counterintelligence officers. The team notified South African counterintelligence, pleading with them to leave the man alone while they tailed him to whatever his target happened to be. But the South Africans, perhaps worrying that some of <a></a>their state secrets might be divulged this way, ignored the pleas and arrested the man within a day or so of his arrival. They put him under interrogation in a room somewhere in the coastal city of Cape Town.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The interrogation went nowhere. And although the group of Western counterintelligence officers were also given a chance to interrogate him, they too were unable to learn anything. Finally, a counterintelligence officer at CIA headquarters, a man named Jim Morris, came to Norm Everheart and sketched out the general facts of the case. Could the Grill Flame psychics lend a hand? There seemed to be nothing to lose.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart was a rumpled-looking, mustachioed man in his forties who bore a resemblance to the early motion-picture actor Bert Lahr (think of the Lion character in <em class="calibre4">The Wizard of Oz)</em>. A senior technical adviser to John McMahon, the CIA’s deputy director for operations, Everheart had been asked by McMahon to serve as the chief coordinator for Grill Flame taskings from the CIA’s Operations Directorate. Both Everheart and McMahon had been involved in psychic spying experiments since the early days of the CIA-sponsored work out at SRI. They had seen, and they had believed, and they were at least willing to give RV a try in operational situations.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Jim Morris, the counterintelligence man, told Everheart that he was primarily interested in answering one question about the KGB illegal. The man was assumed to be getting his instructions via shortwave radio, in some sort of code. The question was: how was the man decoding his messages?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart brought the photograph of the KGB illegal over to Fort Meade one day, and gave it to Scotty Watt. Normally, Everheart couriered target packages over, and received the results back the same way, or sent the actual tasking officer himself out to Fort Meade. But ever since he had received his Grill Flame briefing from Scotty Watt in <a></a>1979, Watt had been encouraging him to come over to witness an operation for himself. This time, he did. Watt brought him over to the ops building, and ushered him into the control room. Inside the adjacent remote-viewing room, Skip Atwater was waiting while Ken Bell cooled down into a trance, watching his golden orb. As the session started, Norm Everheart listened in via headphones from the control room. He didn’t know Bell’s name—the identities of the viewers were the most classified aspect of the program—but what he heard astonished him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Bell, down in his zone, began to describe a man sitting in an apartment on the second floor of a building, in some city bordered by an immense amount of water. The man was dressed oddly. His clothes weren’t street clothes; they were more like pajamas. And they were gray. Like prison clothes, in fact.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The man was with two other people, dressed more normally. They didn’t speak the languages he spoke. But he knew what they wanted from him—information—and he would never give it to them. He was adamant; it was as if he were having a conversation with himself, in his mind, about how sure he was that he would never give up his information.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At this point, Atwater quietly suggested that Bell “talk” to the KGB man, telepathically coaxing the information out of him. It was a strange technique, and perhaps only a metaphorical device that got remote viewers past psychological barriers within their own heads. But the remote viewers seemed to think that they <em class="calibre4">really were</em> “asking” their targets, and in any case, it had seemed to work for them on many occasions.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Bell tried; he telepathically asked the man what was happening. Why was he there? What did the other two men want from him? But it was no use. The KGB man was a rock; Bell’s telepathic queries merely bounced off him. The session finally ended.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>Norm Everheart was disappointed that the session hadn’t produced more information. But he was enormously impressed with what he had heard. He knew few details of the case, but what the remote viewer had described had certainly sounded right. Everheart drove over to building 4554, to find a secure phone. He used it to call Jim Morris back at CIA headquarters, to tell him what the remote viewer had come up with. Morris confirmed it all: the upstairs room; the gray clothes; the two interrogators—everything.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart now asked Morris if he could provide him with any personal details about the KGB man, or anything else that the remote viewer could focus on. Morris gave him the names—the actual Russian names—of the man’s son and daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everheart thanked Morris, and drove back to building 2560. He had Watt schedule another remote-viewing session for the afternoon. After lunch, he came back to the ops building and put on the headphones again. Bell, down in his zone, was beginning to break through the KGB man’s mental barriers. <em class="calibre4">Your son Sergei misses you</em>, he was whispering through the ether to the KGB man. <em class="calibre4">Your daughter Svetlana wonders when you’ll be home</em>. And bit by bit, it seemed, information was coming back. Bell, from the depths of his zone, reported that the KGB man now had tears in his eyes. Bell was conducting one of the most bizarre interrogations—if it could be called that—in the history of intelligence work, and it seemed to be working. <em class="calibre4">Sergei wants me to take him skiing</em>, the KGB man seemed to muse sadly. <em class="calibre4">I promised him I would take him skiing</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><em class="calibre4">Yes, you promised</em>, Bell responded. <em class="calibre4">You need to get home quickly to take him skiing</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><em class="calibre4">I need to get home. This was supposed to be my last tour anyway. I was about to retire, to go back to the USSR</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After a while of this, Bell decided that the man’s mental barriers had been lowered enough, and he started to ask <a></a>about more operational matters. In asking the KGB man about his possessions, he learned about a pocket calculator. Later, Mel Riley was run in a session against the same target, and also came up with a pocket calculator. Norm Everheart knew that pocket calculators, either unmodified or with special cryptographic chips, were commonly used by KGB illegals to code and decode messages.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Norm Everheart took the information back to CIA headquarters, and handed it over to Morris. In due course, Morris contacted the South African counterintelligence officials running the KGB man’s interrogation. Asked about the calculator, they responded that they had found no such thing. Asked a second time, a few days later, they admitted that in fact one of their group had found a calculator among the KGB man’s possessions, and had taken it home with him. No one ever confirmed whether the calculator had been used to decode messages, but Jim Morris and Norm Everheart were reasonably sure that it had. Thanks to the remote viewers, the case was closed.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The term “remote viewing” was, on the surface, a sanitized, high-tech synonym for the old term “clairvoyance.” Clairvoyance, technically, was merely the ability to see things at a distance, in real time. In other words, it was a negation only of three-dimensional space. Yet Atwater, Riley, McMoneagle, and the others in the unit believed that remote viewers also could cross the fourth dimension—<em class="calibre4">time</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">They had no doubt, though, that time was the slipperiest dimension. Moving backward, into the past, was like travelling in a time machine with bugs in its software; you might not end up where you planned. In fact, there were many cases where remote viewers ended up in the past even when they had been sent to the present. More than once, Atwater had to tell Riley or McMoneagle or one of the others to ignore the <a id="filepos112607"></a>interesting civilization they had alighted in, with its pyramids or human sacrifices or what <a id="filepos112708"></a>ever, and move forward to, say, the terrorist training camp inhabiting that space in the present.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Moving beyond the present and into the future was a leap in the dark at the best of times. For some targets, it seemed to work with humdrum perfection, as if time, chance, and progress were only illusions conjured by Fate. For other targets, the future was opaque and confused, as if Fate were hopelessly unable to make up her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day, Skip Atwater was approached by a friend, Don Porter, who worked for INSCOM at Arlington Hall. Porter was about to travel to the Far East, to sit in on secret talks between military and civilian officials from North and South Korea. The talks were to be held in a certain farmhouse in the area of the demilitarized zone. Porter wanted Atwater’s remote viewers to go to the farmhouse a week or so into the future when the conference should be under way. He wanted the viewers to get inside the heads of the North Korean delegates. What were their negotiating strategies? How far could they be pushed? Atwater, explaining that the future was a tricky business, agreed to give the task a try.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Remote viewers by now often served as monitors for operations, and this time Atwater appointed McMoneagle to that job. McMoneagle in turn ran Riley, Bell, and Trent against the target, asking them to describe the “event” he had in mind, at the coordinates of the farmhouse. Unfortunately, each remote viewer generated a different result, and none described a meeting, or even a farmhouse or the Korean countryside.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater wasn’t sure what to make of this, but McMoneagle had a theory. The apparent randomness of the responses, he suggested, was a sign that there was something wrong with the target. Perhaps the event at the given coordinates wasn’t even going to occur. Perhaps there would be no meeting at all. Atwater went along with this suggestion, and relayed it to Porter. Not very impressed <a id="filepos114968"></a>with what Atwater had to tell him, Porter took his scheduled flight to Korea anyway. A short time after he had arrived, he was told that the North Koreans, citing some excuse, had cancelled the meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A similar operation unfolded in the early 1980s, when the CIA asked the remote-viewing unit to check out the new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow for possible Soviet bugs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The new building was designed as a modern, comfortable replacement for the cramped and decaying structure that then housed the embassy staff. The catch was that the new building was only in the early stages of construction; the CIA wanted the remote viewers to look at the building <em class="calibre4">after</em> it had been finished, still a few years in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The reason for the tasking was, for the CIA, painfully obvious. The new building was shaping up to be one of the worst security fiascoes in U.S. diplomatic history. Fearing that Russians would plant surveillance devices throughout the building during construction—especially the off-site construction of prefabricated components—CIA officials had argued loudly that only security-cleared U.S. firms and their employees should be allowed to take part in the construction. The Russians, for their part, had pounded the table and insisted that imported workers would not be allowed, that Russian laborers had to do the job. The State Department eventually gave in to the Russian demands, arguing that the United States could easily clean out any bugs the Soviets placed, and that Soviet labor would in the end be cheaper than U.S. labor. The Soviets soon got to work, and only a few dozen U.S. supervisors were allowed at the site.<a id="filepos116860" href="#filepos131510">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>As a result of all this, the CIA now had to spend substantial resources to evaluate the Soviets’ placement of listening devices in the new building. One of its first steps was to ask the remote viewers to find out which rooms in the finished embassy would have listening devices, and where they would be.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The viewers went to work, trying to envision the embassy in the present and then a few months into the future, eventually moving forward, in six-month leaps, to the mid-1980s. At first they found numerous bugs in the prefabricated walls already at the site; some were real, some were nuts-and-bolts decoys, but in any case they were too numerous to count, much less to remove entirely. Joe McMoneagle even described steel girders and reinforcing rods that had been welded together in a such a way as to serve as a giant broadcasting antenna for some of the bugs. The Soviets seemed to have achieved a remarkable level of sophistication with their eavesdropping techniques. But the strangest thing, for Atwater, was that as he stepped the viewers forward in time, year after year, the data started to fly out in all directions. Eventually none of the remote viewers agreed on anything. Fernand Gauvin, asked to remote-view the embassy sometime in the mid-1980s, described a comfortable brownstone house, with a fire in the fireplace. Something was wrong with the target somehow. Was it too far out in the future? Had the remote viewers run into some kind of space-time barrier?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A year or two later, in 1983, a CIA/NSA team quietly brought a large X-ray machine to the construction site, to look inside the walls. The Soviets, when they realized what the U.S. team was doing, suddenly announced that they were <a id="filepos118856"></a>walking off the job, in “protest” at this impolite intrusion into their work space. The game was up. The CIA <a id="filepos118987"></a>found that the structure was indeed riddled with thousands of bugs and metallic decoys; they would later find the girders welded together as antennas, as McMoneagle had described, in addition to bugs that were actually wired into the electrical system, and giant room-bugs that could be powered by microwaves beamed in from outside. Construction slowed to a stop. In Washington, reports were written and commissions were appointed to study the problem. By the late 1980s the consensus seemed to be that the building should be torn down. Only then would Atwater understand why the remote viewers had had so much trouble remote-viewing the future of the embassy building: The building had no future.<a id="filepos119692" href="#filepos131986">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_23">Some of the unit’s tasks, especially in the early years, involved domestic targets—mostly operations security targets—brought in by military officials anxious to see whether their secret programs could be penetrated by remote viewers. One day Scotty Watt handed Atwater a sealed envelope and told him to send the remote viewers against the target represented inside. Unknown to Atwater, the envelope contained a black-and-white photograph of an aircraft hangar at an undisclosed base. The Army had hidden an experimental <a id="filepos120356"></a>XM-1 tank inside the hangar, hoping that the aircraft hangar surroundings might confuse the remote viewers into missing the target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater put McMoneagle on the target, and McMoneagle started to describe a keyboard-like instrument attached to some kind of computer. There was an optical <a></a>system involved, too. And there were large explosive shells. McMoneagle eventually moved his perception back a few paces and saw the tank. Though he had no prior knowledge of the XM-l’s design, and apparently did not even know that he was perceiving the tank, he eventually produced a detailed engineer-style drawing, with a cutaway diagram of the laser-targeting system, the ammunition storage and feeder, the turret lockdowns, the main gun assembly, and the special high-tech armor. McMoneagle would later declare it to have been one of his best sessions ever. What the XM-1 project’s security people thought was never recorded, but they never came back.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of Mel Riley’s best sessions also resulted from an opsec tasking. A security team from the <a id="filepos121577"></a>Air Force approached Atwater one day and handed him a target envelope; it contained a blurry photograph of what could have been almost anything.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As he usually did when a tasking came in, Atwater assigned it to at least several viewers. After a session or two for each viewer, he evaluated the data, looking for details that more than one remote viewer had described. These details he considered the most reliable, and the remote viewers who had produced most of the reliable data were the ones he continued to send against the target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">McMoneagle, as usual, was a producer on this one. He described an aircraft crash, and saw a suspicious person picking up a piece of the wreckage and hiding it away. Atwater wondered if that was what the Air Force had been after.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Atwater quickly became more interested in what Riley was producing. Riley, in his zone, described a strange batlike flying-wing shape, with a bulbous cockpit like a 747’s. Stranger than that were his descriptions of the aircraft’s control mechanisms. They looked to him like strings, yet when he looked down their length, all he saw was light. He wondered if he was remote-viewing some <a></a>kind of toy. “This must be the screwiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” he told Atwater.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater later handed Riley’s sharply detailed sketches and descriptions to the Air Force team. They looked at the material, and blanched. They told Atwater to give them back the blurry photograph they had provided, and to stop targeting it with remote viewers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater never heard from them again. But years later, he was at home watching television when the Air Force publicly rolled out its B-2 Stealth bomber for the first time. As he saw the bat-like flying-wing shape, he felt a shiver up his spine, and remembered Riley’s session. Riley had remote-viewed his way into the heart of the Stealth program, which at the time had been one of the Pentagon’s most secret projects. Atwater later found out why Riley had described “strings” with “light.” To reduce the bomber’s radar signature, the Air Force had decided to use fiber-optic control wires instead of traditional electromechanical or hydraulic lines.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Remote-viewing sessions as accurate and detailed as Riley’s Stealth job, or McMoneagle’s XM-1 tank job, didn’t happen every day. Even for the best remote viewers, bad sessions—in which the data had relatively little relation to the target—came at least as often as good sessions. Yet Atwater was convinced that a good team of remote viewers, managed properly, could be accurate and reliable enough to represent a significant security threat. The question was, What could America do about it? To the extent that a foreign remote viewer could burrow noiselessly through time and space, what conceivably could be done to stop him?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater bravely came up with a number of suggestions for <a id="filepos125063"></a>psi countermeasures. One was inspired by a bizarre intelligence report about Soviet gift-giving to visiting Americans. The report indicated that such gifts were sometimes intended to serve as beacons for KGB and military remote <a></a>viewers, to help them zero in on a target. Thus, for example, when Senator Junket returned from his fact-finding tour of Russia, he might proudly put his souvenir samovar, a gift from the Komsomol Youth League, on a shelf in his office. Soviet remote viewers, meanwhile, would be asked to find the samovar. When they did, the theory went, they would also sense what was going on in the room, perhaps something that directly shed light on sensitive U.S. policies, or something embarrassing that the KGB could use to blackmail the senator.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As a result of all this, Atwater actually wrote a report recommending that gifts brought from Communist countries should always be placed in innocuous locations, such as one’s attic or basement, far away from any activity or materials that might interest the Soviets. He also made another more general suggestion about protecting targets against Soviet remote viewers. His reasoning went as follows: If a Soviet remote viewer was sent against a U.S. target and began to describe things that were radically, insanely incongruous with the target—say, a large Mickey Mouse balloon inside a missile silo—then whoever was monitoring his session or analyzing his data was likely to conclude that this remote viewer was having a bad day, and if this sort of thing kept up, he might even become a candidate for psychiatric treatment. Atwater suggested, delicately, that if U.S. officials were concerned about Soviet psi-spying activities, they should consider festooning sensitive sites with such strange objects.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Within the weird world of remote viewing, Atwater’s proposal seemed perfectly logical. But most intelligence officials still lived outside that weird world; to them such proposals merely sounded crazy. To Atwater’s knowledge, U.S. missile silos were never decorated with Mickey Mouse balloons.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The Grill Flame project itself, by its mere existence, already drew plenty of scorn from those who knew about it. <a id="filepos127510"></a>One day Skip Atwater was at a briefing for Major General William Odom, who had succeeded Ed Thompson as the Army’s ACSI in 1981. In giving the general some examples of how good remote-viewing data could be, Atwater showed him some sessions on the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow, where McMoneagle had anticipated the later discovery of widespread bugs, girders welded into antennas, and so forth. Odom looked at the RV data, then said dismissively, “Yes, we know that already.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Odom, like many highly educated people inside and outside government, often seemed embarrassed that the Army was spending any money at all on the paranormal. He appeared to believe that, whether or not there was anything to it, it was something best left alone by the military. The precise reasons for such conclusions were sometimes elusive, although in many cases, the remote-viewing program’s supporters thought they detected a whiff of churchly Inquisition. In 1980 President Carter’s Defense R&amp;D chief William <a id="filepos128625"></a>Perry (later the secretary of defense in the Clinton administration) struck the funding for the Fort Meade unit from his R&amp;D budget; Perry’s reasoning was purely secular, but it was rumored that Perry had noticed the controversial unit only because a born-again-Christian staffer for a western senator had drawn his attention to it. Grill Flame managed to stay alive anyway, with funds pulled in from other Army projects, but it had been a close call, and it wouldn’t be the last.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The keepers of Grill Flame, as they might have been called, were an eclectic group, scattered widely around the intelligence community. Many had been converted to support for the program after they had brought in their own targets, and the remote viewers had impressed them with a show of clairvoyant prowess. Some, like General Thompson at the Pentagon, and several officials at the CIA and DIA, had successfully taken turns as remote viewers themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Everyone seemed to know, however, that support for the <a id="filepos129790"></a>program could vanish overnight, especially if there were a public revelation. Yet some promoters of the program were so convinced that they could not keep silent. For example, there was Congressman <a id="filepos129996"></a>Charlie Rose, a North Carolina Democrat who chaired the House Intelligence Committee’s Evaluation Subcommittee. Rose was briefed on Grill Flame in the late 1970s by General Thompson, and also by Grill Flame’s overall manager, Jack Vorona, the head of the DIA’s Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate. Accompanied by Vorona, Rose toured the remote-viewing facilities at both SRI and Fort Meade, chatting with remote viewers and witnessing practice sessions. He even discussed the program with President Carter.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Rose’s constituents in North Carolina lay squarely in the Bible Belt, where dabbling in the paranormal was often construed as flirtation with the devil. Yet Rose became such a staunch supporter of the program that in 1979 he tossed political care to the winds—not to mention security concerns—in a revealing interview for <em class="calibre4">Omni</em> magazine. Condemning the skeptics and “publicity-shy” intelligence officials who regularly tried to snuff out Grill Flame, he made a strong pitch for the program, even referring to remote-viewing data he had seen on an unnamed Soviet target. “What these people ‘saw,’ ” he said, referring to the remote viewers, “was confirmed by aerial photography. There’s no way it could have been faked.”</p>
<div border="1" class="calibre_24"><div class="calibre3">
<p id="filepos131510" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos116860">*</a> Incidentally, the new structure was placed in a low-lying area near the Moskva River, a relatively poor place for intercepting local radio and microwave signals. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Soviets were building a large new chancery building—on one of the highest, best SIGINT spots in Washington, with line-of-sight views to the Pentagon and other key buildings.</p>
<p id="filepos131986" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos119692">*</a> Although President Reagan recommended that the building be torn down, it was later decided that a modification of the existing unfinished building would be cheaper than a completely new project. In late 1994 Congress approved $240 million for a planned “Top Hat” reconstruction project that would remove the top two floors and add four new “secure” floors. The project is scheduled for completion in 1999.</p>
