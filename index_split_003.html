<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This book is about getting the mercury out, so the best moment to start this story is when my exposure to mercury began. It was a Wednesday afternoon. If it had been any other day of the week, things might have turned out differently, but it happened to be a Wednesday, so this is how it went.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On this particular day, one of our teachers happened to be sick, so we had a free class. This was an Irish secondary school run by the Sisters of Mercy. For the nuns, ‘free class’ meant quiet supervised study time. We were in one of the science rooms, so my friends and I crowded our stools up to a bench near the back so we could have a whispered conversation. The topic at hand was my tooth. It had been aching on and off for a couple of weeks. Today was one of the worse days.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You should go to the dentist,” my friend Mairead said. “I went all last month. It was brilliant.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Dentistry didn’t sound brilliant to me. I hadn’t been for an appointment since I was little, but a few years back, I’d tagged along while an older sister had a tooth extracted. The word ‘dentist’ conjured up visions of soaking red handkerchiefs, and my mother scolding my sister, saying she brought it on herself by sticking her finger in the hole to see if the tooth was really gone.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t want to get a tooth pulled. All that blood,” I shivered.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I got mine pulled and I didn’t bleed at all,” Mairead said. “But pulling one tooth is not enough. What you need is lots of brown in your teeth to get fillings.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She opened up her mouth and showed us the shiny silver surfaces on her molars.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Fourteen fillings!” she said. “It took every Monday morning for a month. Do you know how much Maths I missed? Brilliant.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Do you think I need fillings too?” I asked and opened my mouth wide.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh definitely,” she said. “Loads of brown.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Mairead Considine and Áine Ní Cheallaigh! What on Earth are you doing?” the teacher demanded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nothing, miss,” we said, and took up our textbooks in a pretense of studying.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Make sure you go to Dr. Whelan,” Mairead whispered out of the side of her mouth. “He gives lots of fillings.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She wrote his phone number in the margin of my physics book. This was good. Dr. Whelan was our family dentist, the one who’d pulled my sister’s tooth.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Go during your worst class,” Mairead said. “That’s the time he’ll take you every week.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My worst class was Irish with Miss Burke. She hated me, I hated her. It was easier to take in the mornings, but on a Wednesday afternoon, right after lunch, it was torture to hear her droning on about ancient Irish literature. What made it worse this Wednesday was that my tooth really really hurt.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I raised my hand, excused myself and went down to the office, where the secretary made my appointment. I walked out of school, over to Dr. Whelan’s office, climbed into his chair, got the aching tooth pulled, and then blithely made one of the worst decisions of my life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re going to need eleven fillings,” he said. “We can start right away. Do you want the silver ones or the white ones?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“How many times will I have to come back?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Three,” he said. “It’s best to anaesthetize only one quadrant of the mouth at a time, it keeps you from drooling like an idiot.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Great,” I said. This was turning out exactly as planned.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So silver or white?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What’s the difference?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“The white ones are more expensive.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I thought about my parents who were going to foot the bill for this whole escapade.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Definitely silver,” I said.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It would have been very revealing if my health had spiraled down the drain right away. But that’s not how mercury poisoning works. If I sit back now and scratch my head, it’s not easy to come up with a definitive First Mercury Symptom. I loved secondary school for the first three years, but the tide turned and I hated it for years four and five. Did the fact that I had my amalgams placed at the beginning of my fourth year have anything to do with this?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It could have just been a big case of adolescent angst, compounded by difficult home circumstances. I was the seventh of eight children, not unusual for a Catholic family in rural Ireland in the 1980s. By the time I was finishing secondary school, it was just me and my younger sister living at home with my parents. My parents were tired out, uncommunicative, with nothing to give after decades of hard parenting. My younger sister was developmentally delayed because of a brain injury she had suffered during an epileptic seizure. It’s easy to pin it on circumstances, but looking back, my joy and emotional resilience began to slowly drain away during those years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At the age of 18, I left my rural home to go to college in Dublin. I chose Dublin because it was Ireland’s largest city, and I wanted a fresh start in a place that was as different from the insular rural community I grew up in as possible. City life suited me. I enjoyed the independence, being exposed to new ideas and getting free of the conservative Catholic ideals I was brought up with. And yet, I was far from happy.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In my second year of college, I began to have stress-related breakdowns. Exam times often triggered huge anxiety and uncontrollable distress. I was a good student, far more knowledgeable than most of my classmates about many of the subjects we were being examined on, but I just couldn’t handle my emotions and perform under stress.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">In later years, when I learned about mercury toxicity, I read about how the first symptoms manifest as subtle emotional changes. Depression creeps in. There is an unwarranted sensitivity and irritability. Emotional reactions become less reasonable, even as the mercury toxic person insists that their reaction is a totally logical response to their circumstances.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That sums up my college days, and beyond, into my twenties. I sought out psychotherapy at the age of 19 and believed without question that the reason I was feeling awful so much of the time was because I had grown up in a dysfunctional family. There were plenty of reasons for me to feel like crap, top of the list being the fact that my parents had essentially left me to raise myself. They were busy struggling to care for my brain-injured younger sister whose case of epilepsy resisted all drug treatment, and whose behavior problems were off the charts. Why would there be any reason to look beyond that when searching for the cause of my emotional distress?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And yet, even now, I hear my therapist’s voice in my head saying, Why does it have to be childhood trauma or mercury? Why so black and white? Can’t it be a bit of both?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I have put a lot of thought into that question. If heavy metals weren’t in the picture, would I have shaken off my childhood and lived a serene adult life, without the aid of therapy? The fact of the matter is, I don’t know. I really don’t. I know how emotionally stable I feel now that the mercury is gone. How can I tease out how much of that stability stems from a freedom from heavy metals, and how much is based on a hard-won foundation of emotional work I did during years of therapy? There is no way to ever know.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Mercury toxicity usually starts with emotional symptoms. Then a few years later, the physical symptoms arrive. When I left Ireland after college and moved to New York City, every week I put aside a good chunk of the money I earned as a nanny to pay for the best therapist I could find. I knew that I was emotionally delicate and this was the best way to spend my money. I didn’t even consider spending a penny on health insurance. Why should I? I was as strong as an ox. All through my twenties, I didn’t exercise, I ate a diet that was mostly made up of two main food groups, sugar and potatoes. And yet I rarely fell ill. The only mild ailment I suffered from was chronic constipation. But I’d been like that since childhood, it was just the way I was. I basically saw myself as having an iron constitution.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But at the age of 27, I had an episode that made me change the way I viewed my health. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It started with a case of shin splints. I’d had these before, when I was very young. They are pains felt in the lower leg bones, often dismissed as ‘growing pains.’ When I was a little girl, I would cry myself to sleep at night from the pain. And now, mysteriously, they were back. I looked them up online, and found that there was no known cause or cure, I should just take painkillers and wait for them to pass.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">A few days later, I experienced an episode of rectal discomfort, and searching the internet again, I learned that this was what a hemorrhoid was. Yuck. WebMD told me everything I needed to know to make it all right again—more fiber in my diet and Preparation H. Was I in my late twenties or my late sixties? I went to Duane Reade and bought a bunch of old-lady supplies.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next morning, I got a nasty surprise when I looked at my face in the mirror. The area around my jaw was all swollen. It wasn’t red, it didn’t hurt, and it just looked like I was wearing a fat suit on the lower half of my face. What the hell? I went back to WebMD and learned that I had parotiditis, an infection of the salivary glands more commonly known as the mumps.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had no energy that week. WebMD told me that there wasn’t a lot I could do to treat parotiditis, except make sure my saliva kept flowing by sucking on lemon drops. I got dressed and walked slowly, very slowly back to the same Duane Reade and got my lemon drops. When I got back in bed, I lay there wondering what I’d done to make my health collapse. What would happen next? Was there anything I could do to prevent it?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Over the next year, I worked, I hung out with my girlfriend, I spent a lot of my spare time writing, and I also kept one eye on my health. It seemed like there was always some weird niggling health mystery I had to solve. During this time, my girlfriend and I found an apartment together in Brooklyn, and something in the air of that apartment seemed to bother me. I developed cracked sores in the corners of my mouth. WebMD said they were caused by a fungus, and I cleared them up using an over-the-counter antifungal that had the attractive label ‘jock itch cream.’ I bought a humidifier, and that seemed to help too. I also made sure that my fiber intake was high so that my hemorrhoid wouldn’t recur.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I had a good friend called Margaret who was in my writing group. She, too, had emigrated from the other side of the pond, so we had a lot in common. She was an English professor, Fulbright scholar, and dove deep into researching whatever her current area of interest was.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Her health had been the target of her laser-like focus recently. She had gone to the doctor with stomach complaints, and learned that she had ulcerative colitis. The doctor’s proposed treatment plan was to cut out the ulcerated part of her intestine.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Isn’t that insane?” she asked us at our writing group meeting. “Who in their right mind would go straight to surgery as a first step? Do you know how many alternative treatments there are for colitis?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t, but with my little forays into WebMD and googling my symptoms, I could guess that there were a lot.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Margaret, of course, rejected the doctor’s offer to cut the colitis out, and chose an alternative route. She saw a nutritionist who put her on a diet that seemed to consist of nothing more than rice, steamed chicken and kale. She also went for regular colonic irrigation sessions.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“The supplements are important too,” she explained.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What,” I asked, “Like a multivitamin?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” she said. “That whole ‘Recommended Daily Amount’ thing is a fraud. Do you know how much magnesium your body actually needs? You need far more than they can fit in one pill. You have to take them separately to get enough. And my nutritionist says they have to be the high quality ones or you won’t absorb them. He won’t let me buy the cheap ones.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“He sounds really strict,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, he’s a bit of a Nazi alright,” she shrugged. “But the fact that he’s kinda crazy doesn’t mean it won’t work.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Margaret threw herself into her cure. It spilled over into her creative work, and at the writing group we read a humorous and thoughtful essay about the experience of going for a first colonic session. I figured the alternative healing world was full of crazies, selling potions and powders that didn’t really work. But watching Margaret’s story evolve, my position began to shift. Yes, the alternative healing world was full of crazies. That was absolutely true. They didn’t seem to care that the things they said often contradicted basic laws of physics and chemistry. (People could be healed at a distance, thoughts could turn into molecules.) But there was something in there. After a few months on her chicken and kale diet Margaret was cured. It really didn’t matter if her nutritionist guy was crackers, what he told her had saved her from surgery. It had really worked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At this point, at the age of 30, I was by no means sick, but I wasn’t exactly well either. I was intrigued by the possibilities presented by alternative healing.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Given the trash that’s in the standard American diet,” Margaret said, “Is it any surprise that everyone’s health crashes by the age of 30? We weren’t designed to be eating like this!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2"> Hearing that I suffered from constipation, she tried to sell me on the idea of colonics.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s not gross at all,” she said. “My guy is really respectful, he has excellent boundaries. He‘s pretty exclusive, but I can get you an appointment.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I could get behind a lot of what she was saying, but didn’t want to go down that extreme road. And I definitely didn’t want to have to carry a thermos of chicken and kale with me everywhere I went. My younger sister had been on a special diet. After years of every doctor in Ireland filling her up with doses of drugs that would have stopped a horse from having a seizure, she still had hundreds of petit mals by day, and frequent grand mals while she slept. The only thing that had worked was a treatment called the Ketogenic Diet, an extremely low carb, high fat diet that had cured her epilepsy for good.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Living on a hideously restricted diet like lettuce, tomatoes and coconut oil was worth it for extreme cases. But I was not an extreme case of anything, I was just curious. I wasn’t going to go to those lengths, but I began to wonder if a small dietary change might reverse the downward trend in my health. The latest new symptom I’d noticed was moments of woozy lightheadedness and dark patches in my vision if I stood up too suddenly after I ate. WebMD told me that this kind of low blood pressure was a common sign of aging, and I should take care when I stood up after a meal, or I might fall and break a hip.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Were the alternative people right? Had I brought on premature aging through a diet of trash and sugar? I was ready to find out.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I researched online and found a book called <span class="italic">The Diet Cure</span>. The author seemed pretty grounded in reality and science, and the diet plan wasn’t too extreme. No sugar in any form, lots of fresh vegetables, and protein with each meal to keep blood sugar steady. There were healthy snacks like nuts and fruit smoothies. It sounded like an ideal way to increase my overall health.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The author recommended going on the diet all at once, and using amino acids and other supplements to curb sugar cravings and ameliorate any detox symptoms that might arise in the few days of transition. I was intrigued by the amino acids. Tyrosine was supposedly going to give me more energy. Glutamine was going to help my blood sugar, and also heal my colon. I went to the vitamin store and got my supplements and some whey protein powder for my smoothies. Then I went to the health food store and filled my basket with organic vegetables. And the experiment began.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Even today, after all I’ve learned, I’m not sure why it went so terribly wrong. Back then, I didn’t understand that I have the kind of metabolism that responds strongly to supplements even in tiny doses. On the first day of my new regimen, I went to the Y to work out—part of my new healthy lifestyle. I took some tyrosine for energy and I was off. The stationary bicycle had a feature that showed my heart rate as I exercised, and I saw that I was supposed to get it up to about 150 beats per minute to be in the target zone. I pedaled fast to get it up there, and it responded, climbing quickly up to 120, then 135, then 160. I slowed down, but the numbers kept climbing, 172 then 185. I looked at the chart. This was way too high. My maximum heart rate was supposed to be 190. I stopped pedaling altogether, and sat there listening to the staccato hammering of my heart in my ears, my eyes glued to the heart rate display: 201, 202. I started to panic and let go of the bar that was sensing my heart rate. I tried to calm down by focusing on just breathing and staying upright on the bike. What had I done to myself? After a few minutes, I touched the bar again, 185 and falling.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When I got home I googled ‘tyrosine side effects’ and learned that heart palpitations and rapid heartbeat could occur in sensitive individuals. It was easy enough to stop taking the tyrosine, but that was just the start of my troubles.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The next day, I was out shopping, browsing in the health food store, when I suddenly began to feel flushed and sweaty. My throat became dry and I felt dizzy, like I might pass out. I abandoned my basket and got out into the fresh air. After resting a while, I was able to make it home, but I was badly shaken by the incident. Was the detox phase really supposed to be this bad? I read up more about blood sugar and how it was important not to let it dip too low. I made sure I ate at least every two hours, but things kept getting worse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The flushing-sweating-dizzy moment was not an isolated incident. Over the next few days, they increased in frequency until I was having them every couple of hours. I also began to notice a burning feeling in my colon, especially when I lay down at night to go to sleep. Worried, I abandoned the whole Diet Cure regimen, except for one exception. I didn’t go back to eating sugar. It had been such a big deal to give it up, I had read so much about how bad it was for my health. Now that I apparently had some kind of blood sugar problem, the last thing I wanted was to go back to eating something that would make it worse.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Stopping the Diet Cure improved things considerably, but overall, I was now in worse condition than when I’d begun it. The facial flushing didn’t entirely go away. It happened like clockwork every day at about 7pm, no matter what I ate.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Even now, I’m not sure what that was, or why the Diet Cure screwed me up so badly. I think a part of it was the sudden nature of the changes I made. My sensitive metal toxic system was balanced on a knife-edge of functionality. A number of changes thrown at it all at once toppled it. I also know now that mercury was impairing the function of my adrenals—low blood sugar and low blood pressure are big indicators of adrenal fatigue, and are common symptom of mercury toxicity. And I also think that taking in more protein than I was used to shifted my pH in the acidic direction, something that was exacerbated by my generally acidic state caused by my lead toxicity. Not to mention the strain heavy metals were putting on my liver.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But of course, at the time, I had no idea that I had to take into account an underlying case of heavy metal poisoning. I thought that my bad diet had brought about my ill health, so of course I threw myself into the search for the perfect diet. If food had gotten me into this mess, it was going to get me out of it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Increasing my protein had gotten me in trouble with the Diet Cure, so I tried eating very little protein for a while. That didn’t go well. I tried the food combining diet, where meats and grains were eaten at separate meals, but this didn’t seem to work for me either. All through that whole winter, my face flushed every day, and I suffered terribly from the cold. If I didn’t eat right away when I woke up in the morning, I would fall apart and start to cry. I read more about hypoglycemia online, and got a book about diabetes from the library.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The conventional wisdom seemed to be that a case of hypoglycemia could easily develop into full-blown diabetes. I worried about this. My mother had had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with me and my sister, and had developed type 2 diabetes when I was a teenager. Was there any way that I could stop this slide? Did I have some kind of genetic defect in my pancreas?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">By springtime, I had started taking chromium to keep my blood sugar steady, a multivitamin and calcium for general health, and had settled on my version of the hypoglycemic diet. I didn’t eat sugar, but I still ate fresh fruit. I ate six times a day to keep my blood sugar even, a chore I despised. Why did I have to be the freak who had to carry snacks everywhere they went, and ate by the clock? It seemed that every new food I tried caused problems. When I thought I’d found a good diabetic energy bar that would keep my blood sugar up, I’d find that it worsened my constipation and caused my hemorrhoid to rip open and bleed. I was eating an extremely healthy diet by normal standards, and yet my health wasn’t getting any better. My face wouldn’t stop flushing at 7pm despite all my work. My girlfriend didn’t like it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I think it’s time you went to the doctor,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I really was not excited by the whole idea of doctors. I’d spent my childhood watching them trying to cure my sister’s epilepsy and failing miserably.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t have insurance,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You can go the gay and lesbian clinic,” she countered. “They have a sliding scale.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What good will it do me?” I asked. “Did doctors help Margaret?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“They diagnosed her,” she said. “They can run tests and diagnose you if there’s something really wrong.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She had hit a nerve. I was doing everything I could to feel better, but I clearly wasn’t well. When I spoke to Margaret about it, she said, <span class="italic">You’re still detoxing. </span>But I didn’t believe her. This wasn’t normal. There had to be something causing this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” I said. “But just to find out what’s behind all this. I’m not taking any drugs.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I made sure I ate before I went in for my 7pm appointment. Even so, I could still feel my face flushing a little as I explained my symptoms to the doctor.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Do you know what could cause all these symptoms?” I asked her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re on the hypoglycemic diet now?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And you feel better on it?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yes,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well then, let’s give you a tentative diagnosis of hypoglycemia.” She turned and typed it into my file on the computer. “We’ll take some blood, and if anything unusual comes up, we’ll take it from there.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I got a jolly message from her on my answering machine a few days later.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“We got your blood work back, your liver enzymes are a little elevated, but that doesn’t mean anything. Everything else is totally normal, nothing to worry about. Just continue with the hypoglycemic diet if it makes you feel better.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That was it? I’d paid hundreds of dollars for her to parrot back to me that I thought I had hypoglycemia? What a waste of time and money.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Over the next year or so I kept scrambling around, trying different supplements, and reading reading reading. I tried different fiber supplements that people online swore by for constipation, but gave up on them when I developed an allergy to one called psyllium. Besides my customary two days of PMS where my brain went missing, and the hefty menstrual cramps I usually had, I now was starting to get symptoms in the middle of my cycle. I would get cranky and emotional for no reason.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Two years after my first health crisis with the mumps and the first appearance of my hemorrhoid, I was still struggling. Despite everything, I was still constipated, my hemorrhoid bled regularly. The burning feeling in my colon came and went. And my face still sometimes flushed even though I was on the healthiest diet I could possibly come up with. What was the point of working so hard on this if it didn’t make me feel better? Was my case so hard to crack?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took my troubles to Dr. Margaret. I had tried everything else. I was ready to hear what she had to say.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">First I described my symptoms, then I described my diet. Then she asked about my supplements.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Calcium you say?” she asked. “And how much magnesium?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“None,” I said. “Unless it’s in my multivitamin.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh dear,” she said. “No wonder you’re constipated. Oh you poor thing. Calcium will stop you right up. You need lots of magnesium to make you go.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh, okay.” This sounded good.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It will help with an acidic colon too,” she added. “That’s the burning feeling. Have you tested your pH?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nope.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay, order the test strips online, and read up about the acid/alkaline diet. All meat and most grains are acidic, but millet is really good. I’d give that a shot.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I will,” I said. “Thanks.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And one more thing. Learn about your adrenals. Low blood sugar isn’t about your pancreas. It’s your adrenals.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I ordered a book called <span class="italic">Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome </span>by James Wilson. And there it was. The answer to the question my doctor was stumped by. What caused hypoglycemia? The answer was adrenal fatigue. And this was caused by stress, allergies, our toxic modern environment and bad diet. One of the supplements Wilson recommended was magnesium, and suddenly there were references to it everywhere I went. I even found a whole book about it on the shelf at my local Barnes and Noble called <span class="italic">The Magnesium Miracle</span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And indeed it was a miracle. As soon as I added magnesium to my supplement regimen, the tide began to turn. Instead of trying desperately to keep my head above water, I was slowly and surely making progress. Everything I tried now seemed to really work. The acid/alkaline diet cleared up my burning colon. Baking soda enemas cleared up my hemorrhoid problems. Thanks to magnesium, I was no longer constipated, and best of all, it lifted my mood, and I began to feel hope for my future. Instead of feeling like I was on the fast track to old age, I felt in control of my destiny. By cleaning up my diet and taking the right supplements, I had fixed all my problems. And if any new ones cropped up, I could always call Dr. Margaret.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I have a spot on my breast,” I told her one day. “It’s like a freckle, but paler, and—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Don’t worry,” she said. “It’s not skin cancer. I get it too. It’s a fungus called tinea versicolor. A couple of days of antifungal cream from the drugstore will fix it up.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Jock itch cream?” I asked, remembering the fungus in the corners of my mouth.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“That’s the one. You might feel a bit cruddy the day after you first use it as the fungus dies off.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">A few weeks later, she recommended the supplement Ginkgo Biloba for a painful varicose vein that had suddenly appeared running down the inside of my left leg. I was grateful that Margaret was seven or eight years older than I was. By the time anything came up for me, Margaret had encountered it already. I felt like she was an alternate version of me in the future, encountering the problems I would face, and lighting my path by doing all the research.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The Ginkgo made the varicose vein go away, and also had the wonderful side effect of sharpening my brain function. Two weeks into taking it, I was sitting around at work, waiting for the kids I babysat to finish their snack so I could take them to the playground. Their father was drinking coffee nearby, doing the New York Times crossword.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Is it hard?” I asked. “I’ve never done it.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Want to give it a shot?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I nodded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Empty,” he read. “Beginning with a ‘v’.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Void,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No, seven letters.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh ‘vacuous’ then,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Right,” he said, penciling it in. “Now how about ‘coral producers’—”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Polyps,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“—with a y in the middle. Yeah, that looks good.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">On we went, my Ginkgo enhanced brain crackling with all the right answers. By the time I had finished it, I could see a bemused look on his face, like, Who knew the babysitter was so smart?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It was wonderful to feel so good. I was getting compliments on my looks too. In the year since I’d done the Diet Cure, I hadn’t gone back to eating sugar, and I had slowly and steadily dropped 20lbs. I was now below 150lbs for the first time since I was a teenager, and was bang in the middle of the ideal Body Mass Index chart for a person my height. It felt great.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Things weren’t perfect. I often paid a hefty price if I strayed from the eating schedule or set of foods I knew went down well. And I still had weird things crop up. One day I had a bit of a sore throat, and looked in the mirror to see a little white stone emerging from my left tonsil. And so I went online and learned all about Tonsil Stones, little white masses that popped out of some people’s tonsils for no apparent reason. After some nasty headaches, I learned that I was reacting badly to MSG. And finding the right foods when I was traveling or eating out was always a bit dicey. But on the whole, life was quite pleasant and manageable.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And then Margaret found a lump in her breast. The official diagnosis was DCIS, at the earliest stage a breast cancer could be at. But the doctor wanted to schedule her for surgery later that week. She explained the whole thing when we met for lunch at our favorite health food restaurant.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“After the surgery, your nipple is completely gone,” she said. “So they tattoo on a fake one. Barbaric. And this man has the gall to tell me that if I have a kid, I’ll be able to breastfeed fine with one breast. What does he know about breastfeeding?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“So you’re not going to go for surgery?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No!” she said. “Do you know how many alternative treatments for cancer there are out there?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I smiled.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Lots?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She took a book out of her bag and handed it to me. It was called <span class="italic">The Cure for All Cancers </span>by Hulda Clark.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Doctors say that cancer has no known cause,” she said. “It’s just something that happens. Well it’s just not true.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What causes it?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Toxins,” she said. “They’re everywhere. Sodium laurel sulfate in your shampoo. Mercury in your teeth. Formaldehyde in your carpets. And plastic plastic everywhere.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Plastic causes cancer?” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m removing every single toxic substance from my apartment,” she said. “My mattress, my pillows, shampoos, cleaners, makeup, aluminium pans. I’ve filled ten garbage bags already and I’m not done yet. The place is almost empty.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Holy shit.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And that’s just phase one. Next comes the cleansing.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She described the liver flushes and juice fasts and parasite cleanses that would free her body of its toxic burden, and allow it to kill the cancer on its own.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It should take about six months,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And if it doesn’t work, are you going to go back to the doctor for surgery?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s going to work,” she said. “None of my friends want to hear this. Everyone’s trying to convince me to go back to the doctor. They hear the ‘c’ word and it scares the shit out of them. I need people who can support me through this.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I will,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But I was scared too. Scared for Margaret and scared for myself. On my way home, I stopped at Barnes and Noble and found <span class="italic">The Cure for All Cancers </span>on the shelf. Beside it was Hulda Clark’s even more extravagantly titled <span class="italic">The Cure for All Diseases</span>. That was the one I picked up and brought home. I wasn’t reading this just to be supportive of Margaret. I was reading this for me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I felt that I was following in Margaret’s health footsteps. She had colitis, I had a burning colon. She had tinea versicolor, I had tinea versicolor. She was constipated, I was constipated. She had varicose veins, I had varicose veins. Everything I had, she’d had already. And now she had cancer. At the age of 38. Just seven more years until I’d get it too. Unless I did something right now to prevent it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went straight home and dove into <span class="italic">The Cure for All Diseases. </span>There were lists of conditions, but I couldn’t figure out which one I had. What exactly was I trying to cure? It didn’t matter. The cure for all of them was the same. Removing the toxins from your life, killing parasites, flushing your liver. I was disappointed to read that liver flushes weren’t recommended if you had any silver fillings in your mouth. These fillings contained mercury, and it was better to get the mercury out before attempting a liver flush. But even with mercury in your mouth, it was still fine to kill parasites. I was in the middle of writing down a shopping list for Radio Shack when my girlfriend came home.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I explained that I was preparing to assemble a simple electric device called a zapper which, if tuned to the correct frequency, could kill the hidden parasites in my body and prevent cancer.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Ooookaay,” she said. “Where did you get this idea?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I told her about my lunch with Margaret, explained about the toxins and the plastics and the liver flushes, and showed her <span class="italic">The Cure for All Diseases.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Oh sweetheart,” she said. “There is no cure for all diseases. If there was, we would have heard about it on the news. This person is a quack. There are no parasites hidden inside people. It’s all just crazy talk.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It is?” I asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s time to step away from the book,” she said. “And join the rest of us back in the real world.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” I said, beginning to cry. “But is Margaret going to be all right?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“She has stage zero cancer,” my girlfriend said, “Even if it grows a little while she’s trying an alternative cure, it’s still okay. She can go for surgery later, she has plenty of time. There’s no way this cancer will kill her. She’ll really be okay.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Over the next couple of months, we watched the already-slim Margaret turn a bit skeletal. She wasn’t really eating much food. She had her own juicer, and was living mostly on vegetable juice. She showed me how it worked. Carrots and celery went in the top, got mashed against some spinning blades. Juice came out one end, and pulp came out the back. I took a sip and it tasted pretty good.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sometimes I get so hungry,” she said. “I eat the pulp too.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Every now and then, especially after an intense bout of cleansing with bentonite clay, she would report, “I think the lump is shrinking.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We cheered her on, encouraged her and brought her bags of organic vegetables, but wondered if the lump was shrinking just because the rest of her was shrinking too.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But at the end of three months, she announced that the cleanse had been a success. The lump was gone. She began to eat regular food, filled out again to her normal size, and to this day, five years later, remains cancer free.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Watching this not only made me a believer, but convinced my girlfriend too. We bought a juicer and occasionally had mini-fasts where we juiced and ate raw food for a few days. My girlfriend didn’t really want to take it further than that, her health wasn’t delicate like mine. But I was intrigued by the cleanses Margaret had done.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">When Margaret had done the parasite cleanse, it had yielded a number of foot-long tapeworms. I tried the parasite cleanse too, but with less dramatic results. I just got tired and constipated and sometimes passed weird pink rubbery-looking lumps in my poop.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Um, how do you know your parasite cleanse is, uh, successful?” I asked Margaret one day. “Do the tapeworms sometimes come out in little pieces?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Nope,” Margaret said. “Believe me, you’ll know when it happens. You’ll look in the toilet bowl and say, ‘What the hell is that?’”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I kept up with the parasite cleanse, a tincture of black walnut, wormwood, and cloves that I had to take three times a day for three weeks, and still nothing happened. It just wore out my liver. And the more I learned about my liver, the more I was convinced I’d benefit from a liver flush. Chronic constipation and bad digestion were linked with low bile flow, and I wanted to clear the blockages out of my liver and get the bile moving freely.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The only thing standing between me and some serious liver flushing was the fact that I had amalgam fillings. Hulda Clark said that liver flushes shouldn’t be attempted until the mercury was all gone. I ran this past Margaret.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, the fillings have to go,” Margaret said. “It’s not smart to get them done while you’re shrinking a lump, because it stirs up mercury. But they’re next on the list for me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She gave me the number of the dentist she planned to use, a holistic dentist that her colonic guy recommended.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“She uses all the precautions,” Margaret said. “And guides you through the detox with all the right supplements. It’s quite dangerous to go to a regular dentist and start drilling them out.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I took the number and tucked it away in a safe place. Getting my fillings done wasn’t a trivial matter. I was going to do my homework before I took the plunge.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There were a lot of different herbs and supplements recommended online for mercury detox. As I scanned all the different regimens, I made a list of the supplements that were recommended most often: Vitamin C, MSM, NAC, garlic, chlorella, and zinc.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">There was a lot of talk online about the dangers of mercury, but the people who seemed to get sick during amalgam removal were people whose health was in pretty poor shape to start with. I was glad I was doing this while I was still young, before mercury’d had a chance to mess with my health. As usual, the science behind the alternative health advice sounded a bit made up, so I was glad to stumble across a scientific paper investigating the effects of amalgam removal on blood mercury levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The paper described how a number of people had their blood mercury levels tested before amalgam removal, and then at regular intervals in the year that followed. The study showed that amalgam removal raised blood levels of mercury directly after amalgam removal, but that by the time a year had passed, it had fallen down to the level of an average person. This paper reassured me. Even if getting my fillings out made me a little bit sick, it would all have died away by the time a year had passed. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I called Margaret’s dentist and made an appointment.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Her office was on the Upper West Side, your basic ground-floor practice with its own entrance. Receptionist, waiting room, bathroom, and then the hallway leading down to the rooms where the action happened. My first appointment was intake and x-rays, and a blood test to make sure that I wasn’t allergic to the material my new white fillings were going to be made of. This stuff was called ‘composite’ and was a lot cheaper than gold or any of the other non-toxic filling materials.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Since she was a holistic dentist, she of course had an intake form that was pages long, asking me to describe my health in detail. I felt pretty smug saying that my only problem was hypoglycemia, but my diet had it under control. Then after thinking about it for a bit, I ticked another box called ‘Food Allergies.’ That about summed up the fact that a lot of the new foods I tried didn’t go down well, even though I wasn’t sure exactly what the problem ingredient was.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I handed my form over the receptionist.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Áine Ní Cheallaigh,” she read, pronouncing it perfectly: <span class="italic">Awn-ya Nee Kallig</span>. This was the first time since I’d arrived in New York that someone had pronounced my name correctly right off the bat.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re Irish,” I said, and told her what county I was from. Apparently she had just arrived in New York, and wasn’t very impressed with the New Yorkers who were her boss’s clients.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Sure aren’t they’re bonkers, every last one of them,” she rolled her eyes. “They all have these delusions that their fillings are poisoning them. They call here and say, ‘I need to get my fillings out because they’re giving me headaches.’ Headaches, I ask you! Sure couldn’t anything give you a headache! Absolutely bonkers!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I extracted myself quickly and went back to the waiting room, thinking, I’m one of those bonkers clients too. Don’t assume I agree with you just because I’m Irish.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The dentist finally came out and ushered me back to the treatment room. She looked over my form.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Food allergies?” she said. “Have you ever tried going gluten free?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No,” I said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“It’s just that I’m gluten intolerant myself. It’s not only in wheat, it’s in other grains too, and hidden in all kinds of foods. The diet made a world of a difference for me.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Interesting.” I made a mental note to look it up.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” she said, putting my form aside. “Let’s take a look.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">She took panoramic x-rays, and then took a sample of my blood out to the next room for a quick test.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“You’re totally fine with the composite material,” she said.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">We spent some time discussing the precautions that she was going to take to make sure that my mercury exposure would be kept to a minimum during the procedure. The room was equipped with a high volume fan that would suck the mercury vapor out of the room as quickly as possible, and I would be wearing a little oxygen mask over my nose to pipe in clean air.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“And we’ll use a chlorella rinse throughout,” she said. “Chlorella is the best thing you can use to bind the mercury. Now let’s talk about supplements.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I left with garlic capsules, little green chlorella tablets, instructions to take the vitamin C and MSM I’d already bought, and an appointment to take the first quadrant of my amalgams out the following Thursday.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">That weekend was hideous. I fought a growing feeling of doom. Everything was dark, I didn’t have any energy. We were visiting my girlfriend’s father’s house and I didn’t want to do anything. That night, in that isolated country house, there was an incredible storm. I woke up to the sound of the wind and rain hammering the windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“My blood sugar is low,” I told my girlfriend. “I need to eat something.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But she ignored me and wouldn’t help. I began to despair.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Until I realized that this was still a dream, I hadn’t woken up. I tried to wake up again, and got my girlfriend to fetch me some fruit, and sat in the living room and ate it, until I realized that this high-ceilinged room with wooden beams was one I’d never seen before. I was still dreaming.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">It went on and on. I woke up over and over again in different houses, hungry, scared by the howling winds, until finally the darkened room I woke up in was real, and my real girlfriend got up and fetched me a tissue to wipe my eyes, and then went and made me some toast.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“What’s happening?” she said, as she watched me eat.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I think it’s those pills the dentist gave me,” I said. “I’m going to stop taking them.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The only one I’d started on was garlic. I wasn’t surprised that it wasn’t agreeing with me. I’d hated garlic ever since I was a child.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The feeling of doom began to fade the next day, and was gone completely by the time my dental appointment rolled around. My girlfriend and I arrived at the dentist’s office and sat in the waiting room. I was very nervous. Not because of the pain I was facing, but because of the mercury. If I was so sensitive that a couple of garlic capsules could give me nightmares, what would the inevitable dose of mercury do to me?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The dentist called my name and it was show time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">My gum was anaesthetized, I was draped with a paper gown, the huge all-room fan was turned on, the dentist and her assistant donned gas masks, the oxygen mask was placed on my nose, and it began. I couldn’t feel anything, so I couldn’t tell what was happening. Was she taking all the fillings out first, and then filling them, or completing each tooth before moving on to the next? I focused very hard on taking every single breath through my nose, and on not swallowing.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I kept very still, and rinsed when I was told to. At one point, the dentist asked me to bite down on a red film to check out my biting surface, so I figured that she must have completed at least one tooth. I rinsed with the green chlorella rinse again, spat it out, and she surprised me by taking off her gas mask and saying, “You’re done.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I got up and went out to the waiting room where my girlfriend was clutching my coat and backpack. I put them on, walked out the door, and immediately and urgently felt the need to sit down. On the sidewalk, if necessary. It was so odd. I didn’t feel dizzy or faint, my legs had just unexpectedly turned to rubber. Leaning on my girlfriend, I made it to a bench across the street, and just sat.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Well, that was interesting,” I said. “I wonder when I’ll be able to walk again.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m in no rush,” she said. “We can sit here as long as you want.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And so we did. I sent her off to fetch me a carrot juice, and then we sat and chatted, and watched the buses and cabs and cars going up and down Broadway.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">At one point when I spoke, I felt something trapped against my gum, and reached in and pulled out a shard of amalgam. I flicked it off my finger onto the sidewalk.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I think I’m ready to go now,” I said after testing out my legs and seeing that they were working.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Should I get a cab?” she asked.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“No need,” I said. “Subway is fine.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And off I went to catch the train to work. Drama over.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Amalgam removal took six weeks. There were four appointments in total, spaced out so that they didn’t fall on the same day on consecutive weeks, because that was believed to stress the immune system. I could certainly feel that amalgam removal was having an effect on my health. I was feeling more tired than usual, but not tired enough to limit my usual activities. I went to work, and even took up the challenge of writing a whole novel in a month in my spare time. I won the challenge easily, but kept noticing a drain on my energy that had started with my first amalgam removal appointment.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Another mercury symptom reared its ugly head during this time. My hemorrhoid, which had been totally healed up ever since I’d started taking magnesium, opened up and started to bleed quite copiously. Any time it had bothered me before, it had only bled during bowel movements, but now a little bit of blood was always seeping out of my rectum. My period arrived, much heavier, and with worse PMS and cramps than usual. I began to wonder how much blood loss was too much.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Mercury seemed to be having a negative effect on my whole digestive system. I often felt mildly nauseated, and had odd aches and pains in my gut. I wondered if there was anything I could do about any of this. Were the detox supplements I was taking making things worse?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I was taking MSM, vitamin C, chlorella and zinc. This was besides my regular regimen of chromium, magnesium, glutamine and ginkgo biloba.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">First I axed the vitamin C because I read online that large doses of vitamin C acted as a blood thinner. Stopping it made the bleeding much more manageable, I now only bled during bowel movements. Next, I cut out the chlorella, which seemed to help too. Zinc was next to go. As soon as I stopped taking it, the nausea disappeared.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">The following week, I had my fourth and final amalgam removal appointment. Each appointment had been easier than the one before. I wasn’t dreading it at all. In fact, I was very much looking forward to all the fillings being gone. Finally, I would be able to chew, floss and drink hot liquids without thinking about how much mercury was being released into my system.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I’m going to take one more look at your blood,” the dentist said when the drilling and filling was over.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">During the course of the appointments, she had talked a bit about the blood testing method she used. It wasn’t a conventional blood test, but rather an energy test where she held the sample of my blood in one hand, and held the substance to be tested in the other. She said that it worked just as well as a conventional blood test, and though it sounded nutty, I believed her.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Your blood has mercury in it, which is to be expected,” she said, when she came back into the room. “But it also has a much higher level of lead.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“Really?” I said. “Where would lead come from?”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” she said. “Lead is in a lot of different things. But I can get you EDTA suppositories that will remove the lead from your system. I can order them, I’ll give you a call when they come in.”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I went home and googled sources of lead. Apparently it often was in enamel bathtubs or cookware. Some pottery glazes contained lead. I spent the next few days going around the house with the little lead testing stick I got at the hardware store. I swabbed every surface I could think of that might contain lead, from the dishes to the countertops to the inside of the microwave. They all came up negative.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I fretted about it at first. But then as the last traces of mercury faded from my system, and my health returned to normal, I just let it go. I decided not to go back to the dentist to pick up the EDTA suppositories. Messing around with more detox supplements really wasn’t appealing. I stopped taking MSM, the last of the detox supplements, and put the whole heavy metal episode behind me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_9"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">* * *</span></span></span></p><div class="calibre_8"> </div>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Of course the whole mercury episode was not behind me. There were many chapters to go before I could close the book on heavy metals, but I wasn’t aware of that yet. I may have been done with mercury, but mercury was not done with me.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">I didn’t know, and nobody told me, that my years of exposure to amalgam meant I had a storehouse of mercury secreted away in the cells and organs of my body. My breath was the conduit that had, day in, day out, brought mercury vapor from my mouth down into my lungs. My bloodstream, greedily drinking in oxygen, had also taken on a cargo of mercury, and carried it all over my internal terrain. On its way through my liver, my thyroid, my brain, my very cells, it had dropped molecules of mercury. And because mercury also blocked up the hatches that allowed metals to move out of cells, any mercury that got dropped inside a cell had a hard time getting out again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But amalgam removal changed everything. My breath no longer brought steady doses of mercury into my system when I inhaled. My liver and kidneys were able to catch up. Over the next three months, they were able to clear my bloodstream of this dreaded toxin.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But scrubbing my bloodstream so clean meant that my cell walls got a bit of a spring cleaning too. Mercury that had been blocking the passage of metals in and out of cells was now gone. Metals were free to move in ways that they hadn’t been in years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">And one of those metals was mercury.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Not all at once, but slowly and steadily, all the sleeping atoms of mercury that had been sitting quietly in my cells got the call. In increasing numbers, they flooded out of my cells, into my bloodstream, and did what heavy metals do—they caused havoc. Overwhelmed, my liver and kidneys could only excrete a small portion of them every day. And every day, more and more poured out of my cells to replace their excreted brothers. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">Nothing could stop this rising tide. My blood mercury rose far beyond anything I had seen in my sixteen years of amalgam exposure. The organs that mercury targets: my brain, my liver, my adrenals, my thyroid, were screwed. And it went on and on and on.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">This phenomenon is referred to as the ‘Detox Rollercoaster Ride’ or more descriptively, the ‘Dump Phase.’ The first signs of mercury being dumped into the bloodstream appear three to six months after the last amalgam is removed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre1"><span><span class="calibre2">But first, there is the calm before the storm. Before the mercury hits the fan, the patient experiences an incredible reprieve from all their mercury symptoms. It’s a beautiful thing. And it’s the last glimpse of good health that they’re going to see for a very very long time.</span></span></span></p>
