<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">A</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">LMOST FOUR YEARS LATER</span></span>, I <span><span class="calibre13">SAT IN</span></span> I<span><span class="calibre13">NGO</span></span> S<span><span class="calibre13">WANN’S STUDIO IN</span></span> lower Manhattan, surrounded by samples of his artistry. In one painting, a bluish gray, classically sculpted bust of a scowling, bearded man—he could have been Jesus, or Socrates, or perhaps Swann himself—hovered above a landscape filled with pyramids. There were halos around his head, buzzing with zodiacal symbols, and yellow beams of energy burst sideways out of his temples and upwards from his forehead; and from beneath him, from the bottom of his little pedestal, prismatic blue and yellow and red beams poured down like the end of a rainbow onto a great … brain-like thing … that was lying there, soaking up this hallucinatory cascade of colors.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Over at the other end of the studio, by the street, there was another oil painting, a large triptych, all comets and stars and sea, with high and frothy and lacy and soaring <a></a>waves as if this were a low-gravity planet somewhere. And hanging on another wall, on the Lower East Side side, in fact, was a rendering of a strange three-part entity: the first part a darkly bearded young man, naked and well muscled, his body very pink and barred with mauve stripes; the second part a snake with the leather-capped head of another, more rapacious-looking bearded man atop it; and finally, thirdly, a young woman, nude and tautly perfect, her head thrust backward in an orgiastic pose … and the backdrop to the outrageous trinity was a vast sea of water and stars, with cliffs to the right and a gigantic pink tower, spouting a geyser of star-stuff high into the atmosphere of this dusky neverland.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">An easel and a blank canvas were set up to one side of the room, and paints were mixed and ready, but the air down here smelled less of paint than of cigar smoke and, faintly, stale champagne. I couldn’t tell where the champagne smell was coming from, but there was a layer of the cigar smoke just under the ceiling; and poking up into this mini-stratosphere was a bulging cumulonimbus formation, rising from the long table where a paunchy, bearded man of sixty was sitting, clad in an old T-shirt and sweatpants, clenching in his teeth a Tiparillo cigar.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Twenty-nine degrees, twenty-five minutes, seven seconds north,” said Ingo Swann. “Ninety-eight degrees, twenty-nine minutes west.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Across the table, I wrote the numbers down. After my hand formed the “W” for “west” it moved sideways across the page, making a flat line with three angular, box-like protrusions. “Angles,” I said. “Structures.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“That’s a correct ideogram,” said Swann.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And now I was in Stage Two, waiting for basic sensory perceptions from the target to tickle my synapses. “Wood feel … concrete feel … dust … massive.” I realized I was already out of the standard structure—dimensionals like “massive” weren’t supposed to surface so soon.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>But before I could react I was hit by two images that I treated as Aols: “Aol break, dome … Aol break, nuclear cooling tower.” There was probably something domelike at the site, but I had to get those Aol images out of my head, or they would start to distort the data.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After a short pause, I found myself doing a Stage Three sketch, letting my hand draw what it wanted: two lines across the page, a line down at a right angle, and a curved shape, like a crescent moon. “Curves,” I said, and another image popped in: “Aol break, bunkers.” I drew a shape like a Quonset hut. There were too many Aols here. I was going too fast. I needed to take the coordinates again.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann read them to me, and this time I skipped the ideogram, moving straight into stage two—“bark … browns … grays … smell of masonry … stone … bulk … steel … chrome … smells … acrid. Aol break, shipyard.” I started to sketch some more angles, and curves, but it was still too abstract. I declared a break and, after another pause, took the coordinates again.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">This time I sketched a tall column, and then put a top on it. The top grew another leg, and the shape became a table. I sensed that there was water nearby. There was some kind of building—or buildings?—at the target, but I was confused about the precise shape.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On a new page I sketched a large cylindrical object. That felt like one of the buildings. But I sensed something else: “Girders … struts … something falling … sparks … metal.” I drew a metal tower, as seen from the ground. “Aol break, radio tower.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Now I sketched a road, and what could be a railroad, leading up to a tall, narrow, column-like tower, and next to it a squat, cylindrical building. “Aol break, stadium. Aol break, oil storage [tank] with railroad.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann now handed me a knife and some white modelling clay, and invited me to model the target. As I started to shape the clay to form the two buildings, more impressions <a></a>came in. I sensed that the tower had something on top of it. “Aol break, water tank. Revolving restaurant?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I ended up modelling the tower with the watertank/revolving restaurant on top, and next to it the larger, flattish cylindrical object.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When I was finished, Swann slid the feedback folder across the table. Inside, I found a photo from an old issue of <em class="calibre4">National Geographic</em>, of a tower in downtown San Antonio with a revolving restaurant on top, and next to it the large, cylindrical, domed city convention center. Checking a map later, I saw that the narrow San Antonio River—“water nearby”—was two thousand feet away.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ingo Swann had left SRI in 1988, and was now retired, living quietly down in the Bowery section of Manhattan, writing occasional books and essays, and, from a distance, watching the remote-viewing program sink into oblivion. After a few interviews, he agreed to train me over several weeks in April and May 1994. I wanted to learn about remote viewing from the remote viewer’s perspective, and he in turn wanted me to learn from the right teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Remote viewing with someone who already knows the target, and provides occasional feedback during the session, is like riding a bicycle with training wheels on. Even so, I had the impression that my results were not all due to coaching from Swann. In one session, I described a site within twenty seconds—a hot springs in Arkansas, it turned out—based on three impressions, all correct: “terrain … white … sulfur smell.” After the training ended, I had my girlfriend fax me coordinates of sites all over the world, and in solo sessions, without a monitor to give me feedback, I described the targets well enough to overcome even her skepticism. My remote viewings weren’t reliable or detailed enough to justify my employment as a full-time psychic spy, but I was reasonably convinced that, <a id="filepos843553"></a>as General Thompson would put it, “there’s something there.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I knew I couldn’t perform the in-depth, long-term research that that “something” deserved, but as someone writing about remote viewing and remote viewers, I wanted to get a feel for all the variety and the strangeness of their experiences. Which brought me, inevitably, to Ed Dames.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames was now living in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had led an interesting life since leaving DT-S in 1988. First he had worked at another secret unit, this one an INSCOM “strategic deception” and counter-narcotics unit known as Team Six. Dave Morehouse had joined him there, briefly, in 1990. On the side, the two officers had also formed a company, Psi-Tech, with the idea of using moonlighting remote viewers as a kind of psychic investigation team for private clients. Morehouse, Paul Smith, Mel Riley, Lyn Buchanan, and others would provide the raw data, and Dames would analyze it all. Dames convinced the retired General Stubblebine to serve, for a time, as chairman of the board.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Unfortunately, Psi-Tech’s clients were relatively scarce, and were usually out on the New Age fringe of things. A wealthy man in Baltimore asked Dames to remote-view the mysterious “crop circles” appearing in wheat fields in Southern England; Dames provided the man with data suggesting that the circles were caused by flying-saucer-like devices skimming aerobatically over the wheat fields. Later, a group from the former Soviet Union asked Psi-Tech to remote-view the disappearance of a Russian space probe near Mars. Dames again implicated aliens.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames, along with Morehouse, seemed increasingly preoccupied with extraterrestrial matters, and tried to use remote viewing to locate “alien bases” on Earth. There was one base in Alaska, the remote viewing suggested, and one off the coast of South America, and at least two in northern <a id="filepos845811"></a>and western New Mexico—where Dames and Morehouse went out into the desert, in search of evidence. In late 1991, Dames retired from the Army, separated from his wife Christine, and moved to Albuquerque. A year and a half later, in March 1993, he appeared at a local UFO conference and announced that a colony of pregnant Martian females lay beneath the New Mexico desert. Sometime between April and August, he predicted, these Martians would give birth and emerge aboveground. “We’re sure it’s going to happen,” he told his audience. “We’ve alerted the media, and teams of doctors, technicians, and documentary filmmakers are on call and in place to respond at a moment’s notice.… President Clinton will announce it and everyone in the world will know!”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But August 1993 came, and went, and no aliens appeared. Dames, apparently running out of money, began to turn Psi-Tech into a remote-viewing training company, and offered a week-long course for about $3,000. His students included a UCLA English literature professor; an executive at an Albuquerque-based mining company; and Courtney Brown, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. Brown became so enamored of remote viewing, and of what he thought it could do, that he decided to use it to explore the history of interactions between the aliens and planet Earth—among other things detailing the various races of aliens, such as the big-headed “Grays,” and the blond and blue-eyed “Nordics.” Brown would later publish a book about it all, titled <em class="calibre4">Cosmic Voyage</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I arrived in Albuquerque in July 1994, and spent a few days with Dames, practicing remote-viewing the Psi-Tech way. The advantage of practicing with Dames was that he used random-number “encrypted coordinates” instead of actual geographical coordinates, thus making the technique a bit more rigorous. But as expected, I was mostly given unusual, often extraterrestrial targets. In some cases, I was surprised to learn that I had described precisely what <a></a>Dames had expected me to describe, and what other students before me had described—for example, a high-speed vehicle under the surface of Mars. I assumed that this had come from inadvertent cues from Dames during the session, but there were times when the information seemed to pop into my consciousness so unexpectedly and spontaneously that I couldn’t help wondering whether “telepathic overlay” was also a factor.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The only really satisfying session, down in Albuquerque, came when I took out a pair of random numbers that had been faxed to me by my girlfriend; they represented a site she had chosen, somewhere in the world. Neither Dames nor I knew what it was. With Dames as monitor, I targeted the site, and described a place on an island, near a cliff that ran down to the sea. There seemed to be some kind of construction going on at the site; the buildings were unfinished.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The site, I learned later, was a ruined temple to Athena, on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean, on the island of Rhodes. The “construction” I had sensed was possibly an Aol; the buildings at the site were actually undergoing Reconstruction by the elements.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">My days in Albuquerque were busy, intense with remote viewing, and I was insomniac most nights. After half a week I was “bouncing off the walls.” Between sessions, I would go outside the little office suite center where Psi-Tech had its one-room office. I would walk over to a large granite boulder on the edge of the parking lot, sit on it, and stare at a tree a few hundred yards away, and the Sandia Mountains behind it. The tree seemed extraordinarily green. The mountains seemed immensely stark. The sky seemed incredibly blue. While I quietly semi-hallucinated, Ed Dames would talk, a hundred yards away through the heat, on his cellular phone, checking his messages, chatting with his new girlfriend, a former Psi-Tech student who lived in Beverly Hills. One afternoon, Dames came over <a></a>after a chat on the phone, and informed me quietly: “I have a meeting with the Gray leadership next month. The ones in uniforms.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Uh-huh,” I said, giving him the same blank stare I had been applying to the mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">He looked up at the mountains, then chuckled softly, shaking his head. “You can’t tell anybody about this. They’ll put you in a straitjacket.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Yes.” I laughed. “Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ed Dames wasn’t always off communing with aliens in the desert, and on the whole he was intelligent and friendly, and interesting. There are a lot worse people to shoot the breeze with, over a few beers. But I couldn’t help thinking that if I continued to remote-view at the pace he set, day after day, year after year, my mind would eventually become clouded by ETs and spirits, pregnant Martians, the certainty that I was Chosen and could do no wrong. I would wrestle, down in that ancient, Boschean abyss, with the sprites and demons that always seem to linger around psi.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I’d like to think I sensed them once. It was on my last day in Albuquerque. Unknown to me, Dames had chosen his own psyche as the target—“Ed Dames/Deep-Mind”—and I was perceiving grayness, whiteness, wetness, even “madness,” and things seemed to rush past me constantly, always beyond my reach. Somewhere along in the session I detected laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Afterwards, Dames remarked with a smile that other remote viewers had also heard laughter down in Ed Dames/Deep-Mind. “It reminded me of a bunch of little gremlins in the background,” Mel Riley later told me.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And what did you think of that, Mel?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Nothing. It’s all part of remote viewing. You’ve got to maintain a sense of humor. If you don’t, you go crazy.”</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a id="filepos852903"></a>By the time the Gulf War began in early 1991, only four remote viewers were left at Fort Meade: Lyn Buchanan and a DIA civilian named Greg Sloan, plus Angela Dellafiora and Robin Dahlgren. They received occasional taskings during the war, especially when the Pentagon decided it needed to hunt down Saddam Hussein’s mobile SCUD launchers in western Iraq. The research side of the program had now been revived by Ed May, under the auspices of another think tank, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). Ken Bell and Joe McMoneagle, under contract to SAIC, were also asked to help find Iraqi SCUDs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The SCUD search was a classic example of how remote viewers could, in principle, be useful militarily. If remote viewers’ data could narrow the “search window” even slightly, they would save the Pentagon millions of dollars in costs for the massive SCUD-hunt—which involved hundreds of aircraft sorties per day, plus roving units of British and American commandos on the ground. Such a payoff would make the RV program’s own budget, now about a million dollars per year, seem well worth it. But as was now almost always the case, remote viewers’ results probably never made it to battlefield commanders based in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ironically, around this time the program switched to a new and grander-sounding code name. “Sun Streak” came off the rubber stamps, and was replaced by “Star Gate.” It was a name the program would never live up to.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Paul Smith spent the Gulf War in the thick of things, with a helicopter assault unit attached to the 101st Airborne Division. When the ground campaign began, Smith and his unit were among the first into Iraq, and quickly captured an Iraqi battalion—one of the many that collectively threw down their arms in surrender that day. Smith stayed in Iraq for a month after the cease-fire, camped south of Basra. Then he came home, and found another <a></a>job at the DIA, a job that had nothing to do with remote viewing.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The following year, 1992, Lyn Buchanan reached his twenty-year service mark and retired from the Army. He joined up with General Stubblebine, who had divorced his first wife and moved in with a psychiatrist in New York who specialized in “UFO abductions.” Buchanan went to work for Stubblebine, among other things holding remote-viewing workshops at various UFO enthusiast and New Age conferences. Eventually, there was a falling-out, and Buchanan and his wife moved back to Maryland. He did computer work for the government, and set up his own remote-viewing training company, Problems Solutions Innovations (PSI).</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After Buchanan had departed DT-S, only Greg Sloan, Angela Dellafiora, and Robin Dahlgren were left. There were no efforts to recruit additional remote viewers. Dale Graff was officially the branch chief. In the summer of 1993, Graff resigned; he was replaced by a DIA HUMINT specialist named <a id="filepos856247"></a>Al Garfield, and funding continued, but the end seemed near.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos856388"></a>Mel Riley kept in touch with these developments, from up in Wisconsin, but wasn’t much disturbed by them. It had long been clear what was going to happen. The remote-viewing program was now receding into the past, as far as he was concerned. Perhaps it would be revived someday; perhaps not. Whatever happened, he had played his part, and it had been interesting while it lasted.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley now worked at a museum in a town near his home, serving as assistant curator. He helped maintain the exhibits of Native American and pioneer life, and organized new exhibits, and guided tourists and schoolchildren around the place. His wife, Edith, worked as a nurse in a nearby hospital. The two of them, hosting relatives now and then, lived in a cozy house whose backyard was lapped by a branch of central Wisconsin’s Wolf River. Riley could <a></a>take his canoe, on a summer afternoon, and paddle upstream until the river narrowed and became a shallow wilderness rapid, and then when he could go no farther he would relax and drift back home again. There were rivers and lakes everywhere around there, swimming with trout and northern pike, and crawling with crawfish. There were deep woods, and quiet pine glades where he hunted in the fall. There was always venison, and perhaps a rabbit or two, in the Riley freezer.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley had always been fascinated by Indian lore, and now as he mellowed into middle age he read even more deeply on the subject, and practiced Native American dances and handicrafts. Some of the local tribes, surprised by his seriousness about their culture—he was now more knowledgeable than many of them—began to treat him almost as one of their own. He made or was given ornate costumes and headdresses, and constructed a large and very authentic-looking tepee in his backyard. He was invited to festivals and ritual dances from which white men were normally excluded. A local medicine society, a society of Indian healers and magicians, even gave him an otter-skin “medicine bag.” If something difficult needed doing—a change in the weather, the healing of a sick relative—Riley would sequester himself, calmly focussing his Indian medicine on the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Greg Sloan, whom Riley stayed in touch with over these years, also developed an interest in Native Americana, and by 1994, in the throes of a divorce and the breakdown of DT-S, asked to take part in a Sun Dance. A Sun Dance is a crucifixion-like ritual, in which a man, via small metal hooks in his skin, is tethered to a post for several days and must dance, bleeding and hungry, having visions, until the hooks work their way out of him. The Sun Dancer symbolically takes upon himself, wrestles with, and somehow resolves by his suffering, the sins and misfortunes of the people around him. Sloan, a tall, dour man in his mid-thirties, <a id="filepos859481"></a>with dark hair and a thick mustache, would dance the Sun Dance under blazing heat three years in a row. Riley just watched, not really approving, not really disapproving … just watching life, in all its strangeness, as it unfolded before him.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Former Stubblebine aide John Alexander, now retired from the Army and working on “non-lethal weapons” programs at Los Alamos, co-wrote a successful book in 1992, <em class="calibre4">The Warrior’s Edge</em>, about the alternative world and soldiering. Ed Dames eventually decided he could do at least as well with a book on remote viewing. Ingo Swann hooked him up with a literary agent he knew, Sandra Martin. Dave Morehouse, who had been discussing the remote-viewing program with investigative journalist Dale Van Atta since 1989, was also invited to join the project.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Dames and Morehouse worked on the book for a while, but they didn’t get far, and eventually agreed to turn over the writing to Jim Marrs, a former Texas newspaper reporter who had written <em class="calibre4">Crossfire</em>—a Kennedy assassination-conspiracy book that had been one of the inspirations for Oliver Stone’s film <em class="calibre4">JFK</em>. Marrs wrote a proposal for an exposé of the remote-viewing program, and sold it to Harmony Books (an imprint of Crown Publishing) for a $100,000 advance, which he split with Dames and Morehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Remarkably, Morehouse was still in uniform at this point, as a training officer with the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He seemed to believe that he could continue his military career even as he benefitted financially from exposing a classified program. When the deal with Harmony came through (Morehouse heard about it over his field phone, while on exercises in North Carolina) he used his share of the advance to lease a Mercedes. Through Sandra Martin, he began negotiating with NBC</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>for a movie-of-the-week deal based on his experiences as a military psychic.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eventually, Morehouse’s apparent love of dangerous situations caught up with him. In early 1994, an irate girlfriend filed a complaint with Fort Bragg authorities,<a id="filepos861983" href="#filepos871525">*</a> and Morehouse was charged with a number of offenses against the military code, including adultery, sodomy, the theft of an Army computer, and above all, conduct unbecoming an officer. In initial statements to Fort Bragg authorities, the woman mentioned that Morehouse had bragged about his highly classified work at DT-S and other units, had claimed that he could psychically spy on her at will, and had told her about the book he was writing with his friend Ed Dames. Mention of the book deal—which appeared to involve a deliberate disclosure of classified information—set off further investigations of Morehouse by INSCOM, the Army Criminal Investigation Division, and the Defense Investigative Service. Morehouse now faced a likely expulsion from the Army, and a possible jail sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A few days after Fort Bragg authorities had decided to send Morehouse to a full court-martial, Morehouse checked into Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He gave the impression that he was having visions of angels, and was depressed and suicidal. He was no longer competent to stand trial, his lawyers now contended. Remote viewing had destabilized him, and now he had gone over the edge. Morehouse and Sandra Martin now also began to claim to friends that shadowy government operatives were harassing them, trying to shut them up. In one case, Martin told me, some Pentagon operative <a id="filepos863512"></a>had tried to intimidate her on the New York subway, standing over her and warning her “to stop representing Dave.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The remote-viewing community was generally skeptical about all these stories, but by the time Morehouse came out of the hospital, months later, he had what appeared to be a powerful defense strategy in place: The court-martial would become an investigation and exposure not of his wrongdoings at Fort Bragg, but of the classified, politically embarrassing remote-viewing program. A lot of dirty government laundry was going to be aired.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">As Morehouse’s lawyers began to request special clearances to look into the remote-viewing program, and to interview former participants, the Army classified the proceedings, and attempted to keep them from reaching a trial. Within a few months, Fort Bragg authorities had struck a deal with Morehouse. In lieu of a trial on the Fort Bragg misconduct charges, he resigned from the Army with an “other than honorable” discharge that left him neither pension nor benefits. He officially separated from the Army in January 1995, and went to work for Sandra Martin in New York.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ed Dames was now living in Beverly Hills with his girlfriend, the estranged wife of the actor Brad Dourif.<a id="filepos865003" href="#filepos871927">*</a> After seeing a draft of the Jim Marrs book in the spring of 1995, Dames complained that it was heavily fictionalized, and focussed too much on Morehouse. Harmony eventually cancelled the book.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Morehouse, undaunted, started to write his own book, <em class="calibre4">Psychic Warrior</em>, and by the fall of 1995 he had sold it to St. Martin’s Press. Morehouse now alleged that he had developed psychic powers after being hit on his helmet by a bullet while on a training exercise in Jordan in 1987. He had then been asked to join DT-S, where he had performed <a id="filepos865677"></a>various impressive paranormal feats.<a id="filepos865721" href="#filepos872106">*</a> In early November 1995, Morehouse and a new agent pitched this tale to Hollywood film studios. Several made bids, including <a id="filepos865897"></a>Oliver Stone, who narrowly lost out to Interscope Communications. According to <em class="calibre4">Variety</em>, Interscope agreed to pay Morehouse $300,000, plus another half million or so when the film was made. Morehouse began working on the book, the screenplay, and a Saturday morning <a id="filepos866179"></a>children’s cartoon show for Hanna-Barbera—involving a team of superheroes who use psi and other non-lethal powers to combat their foes.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">In 1994 Dick D’Amato tried to move the remote-viewing program into the CIA’s budget, under the Agency’s Office of Research and Development—where Ken Kress, the engineer who had originated the remote-viewing program twenty-two years before, now worked.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Kress couldn’t save the program, even if he had hoped to. The Office of Research and Development—and the CIA as a whole—didn’t want it. Dick D’Amato was not someone who could be easily defied, but the Agency agreed to accept the remote viewers on the condition that an outside review would first take place. The review was conducted by a small consulting group, the American Institutes for Research (AIR), which often did work for the Agency.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">AIR President David Goslin, who coordinated the review, had overseen the controversial Ray Hyman study of remote viewing in the late 1980s, and was known by some as another skeptic about psi. In any case, by the time the study began, the Democrats—led by D’Amato’s boss, Senator <a id="filepos867613"></a>Robert Byrd—had lost the Senate to the Republicans. The CIA could now do what it liked with the program.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In analyzing the program for the AIR study, Goslin interviewed the three remaining remote viewers, and several anonymous intelligence officials who had tasked them during the period 1993–94. Goslin also commissioned an outside appraisal of the recent remote-viewing research by two academics—pro-psi statistician Jessica Utts from the University of California at Davis, and anti-psi psychologist Ray Hyman.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Predictably, Hyman and Utts disagreed on whether there was sufficient scientific evidence for the validity of remote viewing. Hyman said there wasn’t; Utts said there was. On the separate question of remote viewing’s utility in intelligence work, David Goslin concluded from his analysis of the 1993–94 operations that it had not been useful.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The AIR study eventually made the news in late November 1995, and prompted ABC’s <em class="calibre4">Nightline</em> and <em class="calibre4">The Washington Post</em> to run stories on the psychic-spying program. A bubble of media interest followed, lasting several days. Joe McMoneagle, Keith Harary, Ed May, Dale Graff, and others suddenly emerged to give their sides of the story. Why did the AIR report focus only on the last, worst years of the program? they wondered. Why wasn’t the CIA willing to admit all the successes the program had produced in previous years? Why didn’t they just kill the Fort Meade unit and rely on the better, freelance remote viewers?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the mainstream media in America didn’t seem interested in disputing the CIA’s negative conclusions, and the bubble of interest quickly subsided. The <em class="calibre4">Post</em> ended its coverage with a story by its science staff, suggesting that remote viewing was bogus, a mixture of fraud and delusion.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Those on Capitol Hill who had supported the program meanwhile ran for cover. Some refused to return reporters’ phone calls. Others, like Dick D’Amato and Senator Byrd, <a></a>offered only a weak defense of the program: It had involved very little taxpayer money, they said. It had never really been used operationally. It had never been taken too seriously. And anyway, it was all over now.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">A year or so after they were vacated, I drove over to the remote-viewing unit’s old buildings at Fort Meade. There was snow on the ground, and it was clear that no one had been up the driveway in weeks, if not months. Paint flaked off the sides of the buildings, and the aluminum chimneys atop 2561 were now stooped by wind and time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">I parked in front, and walked around the two buildings. Along 2560, the ops building, there were windows outside each of the RV rooms, but through the security bars and window glass only bricks were visible. Finally I was able to get a glimpse inside, through a window that looked into the building’s entrance room, where Mel Riley’s desk had once stood. I saw a beige carpet, a dusty chair, and an open door inviting me into the corridor with the RV rooms. Had the building’s door not been locked, I would gladly have gone in. I wanted to linger in those rooms, meeting the ghosts conjured up in all those years of remote viewers’ reveries. What outrageous stories <em class="calibre4">they</em> could tell!</p>
