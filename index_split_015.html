<p class="calibre_2">I had no intention of doing ESP research. I had no intention of making these spooky contacts. Nothing of the sort. This was just a little side game, as far as I was concerned. And what happened was, people showed up and said, “Hey, we’re interested in this. We’ve been looking for potential contractors to do work in this area. And this seems the right kind of place, and you seem the right kind of person. Do you want a little contract to look into this?”</p>
