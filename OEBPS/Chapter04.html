That’s why, in this chapter, we are presenting a program designed to help you take a second look at some of your preconceived ideas about addiction and about people who are substance dependent, as well as help you better understand your partner.</p>
<p class="indent">This program has six steps:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_46"/>Of course, everyone is different. The information we share with you here is based on what is generally true for many or most addicts, but please remember that it may not fit all situations.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>STEP 1: TAKING ON A NEW ATTITUDE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Our culture tends to take a very negative view of people who suffer from an addiction. We often see them as selfish, even narcissistic people who are incapable of putting their needs aside in order to recognize the needs of others—people who are so self-centered that they don’t see how much they are hurting those they love. Or we see them as weak-willed and self-indulgent, without the self-discipline or self-respect to stop their negative behaviors.</p>
<p class="indent">But these characterizations are seldom accurate. Those who are addicted often feel a great deal of shame about the fact that they are hurting their loved ones. And it has been proven over and over that those who suffer from addictions are not weak-willed or self-indulgent but, rather, strong people who have survived horrendous abuse, neglect, loss, abandonment, disappointment, or other trauma that many others could not have survived. Far from being weak-willed, they have been able to will themselves to go on with life in spite of their hardships.</p>
<p class="indent">But however strong their will, their addiction has proven to be stronger—or, more accurately, the reasons why they are addicted are so powerful that until these reasons are brought out into the open and the accompanying needs are addressed, the addicted person is unable to stop their addictive behavior. Their “self-indulgence” is actually a way for them to self-medicate and self-soothe so they can endure the pain and shame they feel every day.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the experts Chris interviewed for his book <i>Recover to Live</i> made observations about the contributions to society that highly <a id="page_47"/>functional substance or activity dependent people have made and continue to make. For example, Dr. Drew Pinsky, addiction medicine specialist and clinical professor at the USC School of Medicine, said that it pains him “that addicts are perceived as weak or bad. Because one of the reasons I work with addicts is that they’re one of the most powerful, richest, most human groups of people you could ever meet.”<a id="rfn4"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Many with substance or activity dependencies are extremely intelligent and talented people who have contributed great things to our culture. Famous artists, writers, actors, and musicians who have suffered from an alcohol or drug dependency include Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Ernest Hemingway, Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dylan Thomas, James Thurber, Tennessee Williams, Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Orson Welles, Judy Garland, Robin Williams, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, and Steven Tyler.</p>
<p class="indent">As Kristen Johnston, actress and author of the book <i>Guts: The Endless Follies and Tiny Triumphs of a Giant Disaster,</i> so eloquently stated: “A huge number of the recovering drug addicts I know seem to have a few things in common, other than their disease: intelligence, creativity, individualism, humor, and . . . enormous amounts of ambition.”</p>
<p class="indent">Research has shown no evidence to support the idea that there is a “type” of person who becomes an addict or that there is a set of “addictive personality” traits (such as dishonesty, self-centeredness, weak will, laziness, or a broken moral compass). Yet our culture lumps all addicts together, despite the evidence that people come to their substance problems for all sorts of reasons.<a id="rfn5"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Simply understanding and believing this can lead to a major shift in your attitude toward your partner, and with it the way you treat him. Let’s use the idea that all addicts are dishonest as an example. <a id="page_48"/>Dishonesty is an almost inevitable part of managing compulsions. Think of it this way: It is very difficult to meet the demands of daily living (job responsibilities, family, and other relationships) while at the same time meeting the demands associated with compulsive behaviors (finding the time to indulge the behavior, covering up signs of using). Something has to give, and most often that something is being truthful.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding the all too human reasons your partner may lie to you (or let you believe a partial truth, or tell you what he thinks you want to hear) can help bridge broken trust and encourage more honesty. The next time you catch your partner in a lie, instead of blowing up or telling yourself this is further proof that he doesn’t love you, ask yourself: Is it possible that he is . . .</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid of real-world consequences (job loss, relationship loss)?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid you will be disappointed in him?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid you will think he is weak?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid and overwhelmed by the idea of change?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid he can’t change?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>afraid of being a failure?</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Rather than simply branding your partner as a liar, look more closely at when he lies, and see if you can understand why. Does he lie mostly to cover up his substance or activity dependence? If the dishonesty does not spill over into other parts of your partner’s life—and if he feels remorse for his dishonesty—then the behavior is within the range of normal for a person with substance problems.<a id="rfn6"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> He may not be fundamentally dishonest, but rather uses dishonesty to try to avoid being shamed.</p>
<p class="indent">None of this means that you have to like (or even pretend to like) your partner’s dishonesty, or that there shouldn’t be consequences for <a id="page_49"/>it. But understanding why your partner lies can help you stay calm enough to use the communication skills you’ll learn in this book, and increase compassion toward him, both of which should help him become increasingly honest with you.</p>
<p class="indent">Research has shown that the more you criticize someone, even in an attempt to “get through” to him, the more defensive he will become. On the other hand, the more your attitude changes, the more loved and accepted he will feel, and the less need he will have to defend himself or make excuses for his behavior. He’ll have less of a need to lie to you or push you away with criticisms of his own.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>STEP 2: USING NEW LANGUAGE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The second step in developing a compassionate attitude toward those who are substance or activity dependent is to pay attention to our language. We can start by not calling them “addicts.” As Chris notes in <i>Recover to Live,</i> it is important to use language that is both sensitive and clear.</p>
<p class="indent">Labeling has been found to have a demonstrated negative impact both on the person who suffers from the addiction and on how others view and treat him. A label like “addict” is loaded with negative associations that can affect how we feel about the person, how we treat him, and how he feels about himself and his ability to change. Even in settings designed to treat substance problems, a survey of counselors found that they identified the term “addict” with lying, irresponsibility, and denial.<a id="rfn7"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Not only are labels stigmatizing, but they often don’t adequately describe the person or the situation. As we’ve discussed, one description does not fit all when it comes to addiction, and there is no evidence to suggest that there is a specific type of person who becomes an “addict.” Even professional counselors have begun to refer not to “addicts” but to “people having problems with substances.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_50"/>So for the most part, from this point forward in this book, we will substitute the word <i>dependency</i> for the word <i>addiction</i> wherever possible, and use phrases like “substance dependency” or “substance problems” when we refer to those who are addicted. For clarification we will refer to those who are dependent on a substance (such as alcohol, drugs, or food) as being “substance dependent” and those who are dependent on an activity (such as work, sex, gambling, or shopping) as being “activity dependent.” We suggest you pay close attention to the language you use when referring to your partner and his substance dependency problem, too!</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>STEP 3: NORMALIZING THE SITUATION</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">One of the best ways to change our negative perceptions and beliefs about those who are substance dependent or activity dependent is to recognize just how many people we are talking about. We are not talking about a minority of people, but millions and millions of them.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the authors of <i>Beyond Addiction: How Science and Kindness Help People Change,</i> some 22.2 million Americans, or nearly one in twelve, have substance problems severe enough to be classified as dependence or abuse. Over 30 percent of American adults abuse alcohol at some point in their lives.<a id="rfn8"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">According to well-documented statistics for the United States, when we break it down into categories the numbers are even higher, as Chris notes in <i>What Addicts Know</i>:<a id="rfn9"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>17 million with alcoholism</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>19.9 million who abuse drugs</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>4 million with eating disorders</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_51"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>10 million with gambling problems</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>12 million with sexual compulsions</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>43 million who smoke cigarettes</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">To complete the picture, let’s add those in recovery from a substance problem. According to the results of a 2012 survey by the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids at <a href="http://DrugFree.org">DrugFree.org</a>, at least 10 percent of American adults aged eighteen and older are recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. If we add those people who are recovering from sexual compulsions, gambling problems, smoking, and food-related issues we are looking at about <i>one in five of all adults</i>—<i>maybe even one in four</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">This figure is particularly interesting when we look at the rate of childhood abuse. It is estimated that one in three girls and one in four boys worldwide are sexually abused, and that one in three girls will be sexually abused, raped, and/or beaten in her lifetime. We discuss childhood abuse and trauma as key factors in developing addictions below.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking at the statistics, it becomes evident that it is not just weak, immature, self-centered, or indulgent people who suffer from substance dependency. It is a huge number of “normal” people, as well.</p>
<p class="indent">It used to be that when we thought about or talked about drug dependency, we were referring to young people, people in the inner city, people of color, and perhaps musicians, actors, and artists. But the profile of drug dependency has changed. Today, people from upper- and middle-class backgrounds, educated people with careers and families, are becoming heroin addicts or dependent on drugs like OxyContin. High school students are graduating from marijuana to cocaine to heroin in a matter of months. Middle-aged women are becoming addicted to prescription drugs after suffering an accident and needing painkillers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_52"/>Anyone can develop a substance or activity dependence. While many people who become dependent have a history of abuse or neglect, this is not true for everyone. We often think of those with dependency problems as coming from chaotic, alcoholic, or otherwise troubled households, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p class="indent">Recently, a very unlikely group of people have been found to suffer from prescription and other drug dependency—Mormons. Drug dependence has become an epidemic in Utah, a primarily Mormon state. People who grew up in a family where they were taught to never smoke or drink, much less take drugs; people who were raised to value the body and think of it as a temple; and people who grew up in affluent homes with strong family support are now among those who have a drug dependence.</p>
<p class="indent">One reason for the increasing numbers of people with substance dependency is that we have created an environment and a culture in which we are cut off from others and ourselves. The rise of addiction can be seen as a symptom of a deeper sickness in the way we live. As Chris wrote in his book <i>What Addicts Know</i>: “As a culture we’ve become addicted not only to gambling, drugs, alcohol, and the other usual suspects, but also to technology, the acquisition of material possessions, and every conceivable promise of instant gratification. We eat more, spend more, take more risks, and abuse more substances . . . only to feel more depressed, unsatisfied, discontent, and unhappy.”<a id="rfn10"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">We are constantly striving for more—more “things,” more stimulation, more success or public recognition. What we are left with is what Chris calls “the throbbing emptiness” that sets in when we realize that these things do not fulfill us.</p>
<p class="indent">When we view substance dependence as a symptom of being disconnected from ourselves and from others, and realize that we all suffer from this same problem, we see that our partner is not so different from us, and our compassion increases.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_53"/><b>STEP 4: ASSUMING YOUR PARTNER HAS A REASON FOR USING</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The mental health and substance abuse treatment communities have only recently come to realize what those who work with victims and abusers have known for many years—namely, that those who suffer from substance abuse were usually traumatized in childhood. Your partner is likely no different.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common form of trauma is childhood abuse or neglect, but it can also include suffering the loss of a parent or other loved one, being abandoned, or being severely bullied by peers.</p>
<p class="indent">Negative self-concepts that develop as a result of traumas such as childhood abuse have the potential to persist throughout one’s lifespan. Many adult survivors of childhood abuse engage in unhealthy coping strategies, such as problematic alcohol use, in an attempt to lessen their lasting experience of distress and/or negative self-appraisals.<a id="rfn11"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">According to Miles Adcox, CEO of Onsite Workshops in Tennessee, a treatment center devoted to therapeutic trauma and compulsivity programs: “You can say that all self-defeating, self-destructive, persistent, resistant-to-change behavior is rooted in trauma—trauma that was most likely born out of a family system.” He adds, “I actually see this a little stronger in the process addictions, such as gambling.”<a id="rfn12"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Chris:</b> How do you define trauma? A case can be made that simply being human is traumatic, no matter what life circumstances you were born into. If you were blessed to be delivered into a loving environment, you have a much better chance of not being seriously traumatized by this world. Few of us are so lucky, unfortunately. And all the cumulative traumas we absorb early in life, whatever form those traumas take, influence how we relate to other people.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><a id="page_54"/><i>My parents carried the genetics of addiction, which always makes the giving of unconditional love more challenging. I grew up in a culture of power, sex, and control. The men were tolerated—even celebrated—in pursuing whatever they wanted, simply because they were powerful and attractive. They engaged in a permissiveness and selfishness that today I could not and would not choose to live with.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>I was eight years old when I first experienced trauma in an overt way, in the form of public violence. The culture of chemical and behavioral addiction I was growing up in went from a future handicap in my efforts to establish healthy, loving relationships to game over. I was in a Catholic grade school class on November 22, 1963, when the nuns came to get me and told me that the president—my Uncle Jack—had been shot. In an instant my life went from light to dark. The murder of my uncle led to the breakup of my parents’ marriage, a move cross-country, an absent father, and an emotionally devastated mother. It was confusing and terrifying.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>Then, when I was thirteen, it happened again. On June 5, 1968, I came down for breakfast and was told by the woman who took care of my sisters and me that my Uncle Bobby had been assassinated. My mother was in California working with her brother on his presidential campaign. This time, there would be no glimmer of hope that we would survive the pain of it all. What was lost that day for our family and our generation was not just the man, but also the belief that bold men with new ideas could make a difference and change the world for the better. We tried as a family to believe in the ethic that one person can make a difference and that all of us should try, but the violence diminished us. We persevered—through force of will, self-medication, and never breathing a word about what had happened—but the trauma devastated everyone.</i> <a id="page_55"/><i>My mother became emotionally unreliable from those days forward. I wanted to help her but couldn’t. She tried to be there for me as my own addictions flourished but couldn’t.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>As for my father, Peter Lawford, he would show up in New York and take us out to dinner a couple times a year. He attempted to bond with me later, when I was in my early twenties, but the effort was haphazard and more detrimental than if he had not tried at all. He was dying from his own addictions and wounds and couldn’t see anything wrong with bringing his only son along for the ride. He didn’t know how to be a father and he no longer had the will or capacity to learn.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>The murders of my uncles spread posttraumatic stress disorder throughout my entire family—none of us were spared—and that trauma reoccurs to this day. Unaware people continue to bring up the subject of my uncles’ deaths with Kennedy family members, as if the trauma no longer affects us. In 2013, fifty years after the murder of President Kennedy, a woman came up to me and began giving me her take on one of the many conspiracy theories behind the murder of my uncle. Though I didn’t even acknowledge my PTSD until about five years ago, I am now acutely aware how this sort of psychic damage often remains undiagnosed, even when it’s expressed as active addiction.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>I recognize now that my trauma contributed significantly to my embrace of drug addiction as a way to cope. Being aware of this brings some understanding to those lost decades of my life, along with the awareness that the drugs I took might have actually saved my life. I am not sure that I would have made it without chemicals to take the edge off the pain, if only temporarily. That awareness fortifies me in my recovery, sustains me when the going gets tough, and, most of all, allows me to have compassion for myself.</i></p>

<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span>As a counselor, Beverly has specialized for thirty-five years in working with adults who were abused as children. Most of her clients suffer from <i>debilitating shame</i>: shame so all-consuming that it negatively affects every aspect of a person’s life—his perception of himself, his relationships with others, his ability to be intimate with a romantic partner, his ability to risk and achieve success in his career, and his overall physical and emotional health. While everyone experiences shame from time to time, and many have issues related to shame, adult victims of childhood abuse suffer from shame more often and have far more issues related to shame than any other group of people.</p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>Victims of childhood abuse tend to feel shame because, as human beings, we want to believe that we have control over what happens to us. When that belief is challenged by a victimization of any kind, we feel humiliated. We imagine that we should have been able to defend ourselves. And because we weren’t able to do so, we feel helpless and powerless. This powerlessness leads to humiliation and shame.</p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>While all victims feel the humiliation connected with powerlessness, men tend to feel it even more than women since even as young boys, they internalize the cultural expectation that they should be tough and strong and that weakness is frowned upon.</p>
<p class="blockpi-l"><span class="hide">                  </span>It is especially shaming to a child when a parent abuses him, violating his body and integrity. Because parental love is so important, children will make up all kinds of excuses for a parent’s behavior—even abusive behavior. Most often the child ends up blaming himself for “causing” his parent to abuse him, which protects him from facing the truth about his parents’ abuse but at the same time locks him into a pattern of self-blame.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_57"/>The more you can learn about your partner’s childhood, and the clearer a connection you can draw between his history and why he uses, the easier it may be for you to treat him with compassion. But simply reminding yourself that there is a reason behind your partner’s addiction, even if that reason is not immediately apparent to you, can help you feel more compassionate toward him.</p>
<div class="boxs">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Beverly’s client Wendy came to see her about her husband’s work-aholism. Here’s how she described the situation:</b></p>
<p class="block0s"><span class="hide">                  </span>My husband works ten to twelve hours a day and often works on weekends. Even when he is at home he is constantly answering the phone or working on the computer. He has essentially become a stranger to me and the kids. For years now he has promised to spend more time at home, but I can see that he is never going to change. I’ve tried nagging, blackmailing, threatening, trying to make him feel guilty . . . but nothing works. I stayed with him for the kids but now I realize they don’t really have a father anyway. I’ve come to therapy as a last resort. I need to know that I’ve done everything possible to save my marriage.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Beverly explained to Wendy that the first step was for her to understand all she could about her husband’s activity dependence. Beverly assumed that, like all substance dependent people, Craig was “addicted” to work because it provided him some kind of reward and because it helped him run away from or cope with his pain or shame. She explained these two concepts to Wendy and gave her a homework assignment.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>The first part of the assignment was for her to write about the reasons why her husband might be feeling pain or shame, and in particular about any trauma or abuse he might have experienced in his childhood. The second part was for her to write about the rewards she imagined her husband received from his excessive working behavior.</p>
<p class="blocksi-bs1"><span class="hide">                  </span>The next week, Wendy showed an immediate change in her attitude: “I always knew Craig had a rough childhood—he’d talked <a id="page_58"/>about it at the beginning of our relationship. But somehow I had forgotten about it.” She explained:</p>
<p class="block00s"><span class="hide">                  </span>His mother was a very domineering and critical woman. She criticized Craig for not getting good enough grades in school and for not being popular enough. And she complained constantly about Craig’s father not making enough money. Craig often overheard her telling his father that she had made a mistake to marry such a loser—that she could have had her pick of men who would have made a lot more money. Craig had told me that he thought his father was a wimp to put up with that kind of treatment from his mother. But he had also told me that her complaints about him and his father had motivated him to try harder—that in a way her high expectations had made him want to be a success.</p>
<p class="block0si-bs1"><span class="hide">                      </span>The connection is so clear to me now. Craig has been working so hard because he didn’t want to be like his father—a failure. And in a weird way, he is still trying to impress his mother. Every time he sees her he brags about how well his business is doing. And he’s constantly buying her things—a new appliance, even a new car. It’s like he’s buying her love. Poor guy.</p>
<p class="blocksi-bs1"><span class="hide">                  </span>Beverly asked Wendy if she was now willing to help Craig with his dependence on work:</p>
<p class="block0s"><span class="hide">                  </span>Yes, for the first time in a long time I don’t feel angry with him. And I’m not taking his constant working personally. For so long I assumed he just didn’t want to be around me. Now I realize he had completely different reasons for his behavior.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Wendy’s realizations allowed her to understand that when she shamed Craig for working long hours, she was unwittingly repeating his mother’s behavior—something she never wanted to do. Instead, Beverly suggested that when Craig came home late Wendy could say something like, “You look exhausted. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?” and that when he came home at a decent hour, Wendy could give him a big hug and say something like, “I’m so glad you’re home. I love having you here in the evenings.” (We’ll discuss this rewarding type of behavior in later chapters.)</p>

<p class="noindent">The fifth step to developing a new attitude toward your partner is to learn more about substance dependency, including where it comes from and how it works.</p>
<p class="indent">While there are no easy answers, we now know that addiction is the result of a complex interaction of multiple factors. These include a person’s genetic and psychological makeup and experience, developmental and social history, and even the expectations of the culture in which he lives.<a id="rfn13"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>The Role of the Brain in Dependency Problems</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some of the most recent discoveries in the science of addiction have focused on a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is concentrated in the brain’s reward system and pleasure centers—the areas most impacted by substance use and compulsive behaviors. Thanks to a combination of genetics and environment, some people’s <a id="page_60"/>brains generate more dopamine than others; those people have the capacity to enjoy a larger range of experiences than others.</p>
<p class="indent">Dopamine is what makes us feel good. It is naturally generated through ordinary, pleasurable activities like eating and having sex, and it is the brain’s way of rewarding us for activities necessary for our survival. It focuses our attention on the cues that surrounded whatever thing or activity made us feel good. (These cues eventually become triggers, as will be explained in <a href="Chapter10.html">chapter 10</a>.)<a id="rfn14"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Drugs and alcohol (and certain behaviors) turn on a flood of dopamine in the brain; as a result, we feel good, even euphoric. But dopamine produced by these artificial means immediately throws our pleasure and reward systems out of whack. Flooding the brain repeatedly with dopamine has a dangerous long-term effect: It creates what is referred to as <i>tolerance,</i> a state in which we lose our ability to produce or absorb dopamine and therefore need more and more of it artificially just to feel okay. In short, the brain is forced to compensate for artificially high levels of dopamine by decreasing its own production of it or by reducing the number of dopamine receptors (thus desensitizing itself)—or both.<a id="rfn15"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A lowered level of dopamine is a big part of what creates “cravings”—physiological drives to regain the normal dopamine balance of the brain. The strength of these cravings can lead a person to continue using a substance even when he is experiencing negative consequences and despite a strong desire to change. Depending on the length of time and quantities the person has been using, their cravings can be extremely uncomfortable and powerful.<a id="rfn16"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The dopamine system will begin to recover as soon as it’s no longer being flooded, but it takes time, and people tend to feel worse before they feel better. Their brains are telling them that by stopping using, something is wrong—no matter how well intentioned they are or how much effort they put into recovery. This is a huge factor in relapse. (Knowing this can help you and your partner make it <a id="page_61"/>through this recovery period. Medication and behavioral strategies can also help, as we will discuss in coming chapters.)</p>
<p class="indent">Dopamine balance is not the only thing that is affected by repeated substance use. Activity in key structures in the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, is also disrupted. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain where we assess risks, weigh consequences, and make plans. It acts as a “braking system,” making possible the judgments and decisions that help us rein in our impulses. When flooded with a substance, such as alcohol or drugs, this part of the brain basically shuts down. The limbic system is responsible for emotions and basic drives; it’s where our desires and sense of urgency come from. Under the influence of a substance or compulsive behavior, this part of the brain gets excited into overdrive. And like the cravings that arise from low levels of dopamine, “the runaway limbic system is also an automatic, physiological process that is outside conscious control.”<a id="rfn17"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">With the prefrontal cortex shut down and the limbic system overexcited, someone with substance dependencies is very likely to go forward with the impulse to use. “A brain in this state will register the smell of marijuana being smoked, the desire to smoke it, and anticipate the feeling that comes along with smoking it, while the reasons not to smoke it disappear.”<a id="rfn18"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Knowing all this—understanding why it’s so difficult, biologically, for your partner to stop using—can make it easier to be compassionate toward him as he attempts to do so. And the latest research can also give you hope: Scientists in the exciting field of interpersonal neurobiology are proving that other people can affect us all the way down to a molecular level. Our brains are changed by our relationships, which means that you can compete with the physiological effects drugs have on your partner. Your love, empathy, encouragement, and limits have strong physiological effects, too.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_62"/><b>Isolation as a Factor in Drug Dependence</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">For years it was believed that drugs like cocaine and heroin are biologically addictive, meaning that anyone who took them for a period of, say, twenty-one days was highly likely to become an addict. This belief came in part from rat experiments in which a rat, put into a cage with two water bottles—one containing only water, the other laced with heroin or cocaine—almost always became obsessed with the drugged water and kept coming back for more and more until it killed itself.</p>
<p class="indent">But in the 1970s, Bruce Alexander, a professor of psychology in Vancouver, noticed something about these experiments: The rats were put in cages alone, with nothing to do but take the drugs. What would happen, he wondered, if that weren’t the case? He built Rat Park, a lush cage in which the rats had colored balls and the best rat food and tunnels to scamper down, plus plenty of other rats to interact with. And then he ran the experiment again, isolating some test subjects while putting others together in his newly built cage.</p>
<p class="indent">All the rats tried both water bottles, but what happened next was startling. The rats who lived in Rat Park didn’t like the drugged water. They mostly shunned it, consuming less than a quarter of the drugs that the isolated rats used, and none of them died. All the isolated rats became heavy users, but none of the Rat Park rats did.</p>
<p class="indent">Just in case you doubt the implications of the Rat Park experiments for humans, consider the case of heroin use in the military during the Vietnam War. According to a study published in the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry,</i> some 20 percent of US soldiers became addicted to heroin while in Vietnam because it was reported to be as common as chewing gum. Many people were understandably worried that a huge number of soldiers would return home as addicts. But, in fact, according to the same study, some 95 percent of the addicted soldiers simply stopped using once they returned home.</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander maintains that this discovery is a profound challenge to both the view that addiction is a moral failing and the view that <a id="page_63"/>addiction is a disease of a chemically hijacked brain. He argues, instead, that addiction is an adaptation. In other words, the reason your partner is addicted is not him, it’s his cage.</p>
<p class="indent">Alexander took his rat experiments further to investigate whether those who develop addictions have their brains hijacked to the point that they can’t recover. He reran the early experiments where the rats were left alone, and let the rats use for fifty-seven days. Then he took them out of isolation and placed them in Rat Park. What happened was striking. The rats seemed to have a few twitches of withdrawal but soon stopped their heavy use and went back to a normal life. The Rat Park habitat saved them.</p>
<p class="indent">People are frequently given diamorphine, the medical name for heroin, for pain relief when they are hospitalized for an injury. The heroin patients receive in hospitals is purer and more potent than the heroin used by street addicts. If drug addiction is caused by drugs, then we should find that many people leave the hospital addicted to heroin. But it virtually never happens. Typically, medical users just stop, despite sometimes months of use. So, why does the same drug, used for the same length of time, turn street users into desperate addicts? The street addict is likely similar to the rats in those first experiments—isolated, and with only one source of solace: the drug. Many medical patients are like the rats in Rat Park. They go home to a life where they are surrounded by people who they love and who love them. The drug is the same, but the environment is different. (As far as we know, there has been no follow-up research to discover what happens to medical patients who don’t go home to people who love them—whether they are more inclined to become addicted.)</p>
<p class="indent">The story we have been told—that the cause of addiction is chemical—isn’t false. But what is emerging from the latest addiction research is that the human need for connection is at least as important. Human beings have a deep need to bond and form connections. If we can’t connect with each other, we will connect with whatever <a id="page_64"/>we can find. In other words, <i>it is disconnection that drives addiction</i>. A heroin addict bonds with heroin because he can’t bond as fully with anyone or anything else.<a id="rfn19"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Chris shared his experience of the connection between isolation and his drinking and drug dependence in <i>Recover to Live:</i></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span>This disease is so much about feeling isolated and believing that you’re the only person with this issue. Because of my family upbringing, I had a lot of rationalizations around being different: <i>Nobody is like me. I am special. My situation is unique.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>But when you walk into a room full of strangers and open yourself up, just for a little bit, you see that everybody is really just like you. I went into my first [12-Step recovery] meeting and a guy was telling what sounded like my story . . . and in that moment of mutual identification our connection obliterated my sense of uniqueness.<a id="rfn20"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">So it is important to remember another reason why compassion is so crucial: It can reduce your partner’s feelings of isolation. And understanding isolation’s role in addiction can help you remember not to respond to your partner’s behavior in ways that exacerbate those feelings.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>The Role of Genes, the Family, and Abuse in Substance Dependence</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">For many years now, scientists have argued that addictions such as alcoholism are strongly influenced by genetics. In fact, some have stated unequivocally that the single most reliable indicator of risk for future alcohol and drug problems is family history.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_65"/>According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA), many scientific studies, including research conducted with twins and children of alcoholics, have demonstrated that genetic factors influence alcoholism. Children of alcoholics are about four times more likely than the general population to develop alcohol dependence problems. Children of alcoholics also have a higher risk of developing many other behavioral problems.</p>
<p class="indent">However, scientists have not found an “addiction gene.” They have found evidence of different genetic vulnerabilities, but the relationship between genes and behavior, between what we inherit and what we do, is complicated. <i>Heritability</i> refers to how much genetic factors account for a person’s risk of an illness or disorder, relative to another person’s. The heritability of addictions ranges from 40 to 70 percent, depending upon the substance. These rates are in line with those of mood, anxiety, and other disorders that are considered moderately genetically driven.<a id="rfn21"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Even alcoholism, which is considered more heavily influenced by genetics than other addictions, is not determined only by one’s genes. Indeed, more than half of all children of alcoholics do not become alcoholics themselves. The research shows that many factors influence one’s risk. Environmental and social factors such as childhood neglect or abuse, trauma, loss of a parent as a child, and poor parent-child relationships have been found to predict substance problems, as has starting use early in life. And genes are not the only things that children inherit from their parents. Children are also influenced by how their parents behave—how they treat each other and their children—and these aspects of family life also affect the risk for alcoholism. In particular, researchers believe that certain family circumstances can increase a person’s risk:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>An alcoholic parent is depressed or has other psychological problems.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_66"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Both parents abuse alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>The parents’ alcohol abuse is severe.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Conflicts lead to aggression and violence in the family.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">An even stronger risk factor for alcoholism than these, however, is childhood physical or sexual abuse. Childhood abuse is linked to a variety of maladaptive outcomes that can extend into adulthood, including both internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation) and externalizing problems (conduct disorders, aggression, inappropriate or early sexual behavior), but alcohol use disorders are one of the most significant. In fact, the connection between childhood abuse and alcohol use disorders is so strong that practitioners working with adults who are already abusing alcohol are strongly encouraged to identify whether a life event such as abuse may be responsible.</p>
<p class="indent">It is even clearer that activity-based addictions such as compulsive gambling, eating, and shopping, as well as sexual addictions, are not primarily caused by genetics but by the family environment and other childhood experiences. Childhood abuse and neglect in particular are key factors in developing food addictions and sexual addictions.</p>
<p class="indent-bs1">You may already know that your partner was emotionally, physically, or sexually abused as a child. If this is the case, open your mind and heart to the very strong possibility that this is the main reason for his substance or activity dependence. The pain of childhood abuse or neglect, especially if the abuse or neglect is ongoing, can be so unbearable that the child must find an escape from it or a way to soothe his pain. This escape or “self-medication” can come in the form of dissociation or fantasy, ingesting substances such as sugar (many addicts report that sugar was their first “drug”), or overeating. Children who are emotionally deprived or sexually abused may begin to compulsively masturbate at an early age—the precursor to sexual addiction.</p>

<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="blockp">If you do not know that your partner was a victim of some kind of abuse as a child but strongly suspect this is the case, it is okay to ask him. Choose a time and place when he seems open to talking (and when he is not under the influence) and start a discussion about it. You can even say that you are reading a book that points to a strong correlation between child abuse and substance dependency and you wonder if he was ever abused. However, if he seems closed to talking to you about it or flat-out denies it, drop the subject—even if you are convinced that he was, in fact, abused.</p>
<p class="blockpi-la"><span class="hide">                  </span>If you haven’t thought of this possible connection before, you can refer to <a href="Appendix1.html">Appendix I</a>, where we present descriptions of the various forms of childhood abuse and neglect.

<h4 class="h4c">PUTTING YOURSELF IN YOUR PARTNER’S PLACE</h4>
<div class="top">
<p class="numb">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Imagine that you are in terrible physical pain. If you discovered that there was something available to you that would relieve that pain, wouldn’t you take it?</p>

<p class="numb">3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Imagine that what you took caused you to behave in ways that hurt you or hurt your loved ones. Would you still take the substance?</p>
</div>
<p class="indentb">Even if you answered “no” to these questions, hopefully thinking about the dilemma your partner experiences has helped you gain some compassion for him.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent2">People who use a substance or activity to relieve their pain or shame do not start out knowing it will get out of control. They don’t know ahead of time that they will continue using even if it harms themselves or someone else. They start because they are in horrible pain and are desperate for relief—any relief. When they find that relief, whatever the form, it feels so overwhelmingly good that they are compelled to use it again—and again. The memory of the relief gets stored in their brain and in their body, and like the proverbial pigeon pecking at the bell in order to get the seed long after the supply of seed stops coming, they continue taking the substance even after they have built up such a tolerance that it no longer takes away <a id="page_69"/>the pain the way it used to. They increase the amount, hoping to reclaim that first experience of relief, only to find they need more and more for even a diminished effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Can we really blame someone who is in such severe pain for using whatever substance or activity he can find to minimize that pain? Can we fault that person for seeking that relief again, no matter how much it may harm him, when the pain returns? And can we expect a person who already feels out of control, someone who already feels terrible about himself, to care how he acts as long as he finds relief from his pain?</p>
<p class="indent">Gaining compassion and empathy for why your partner uses doesn’t mean that you do not hold him responsible for his behavior. It just means that instead of spending your time and energy blaming and criticizing your partner for his choice to continue self-medicating, or being angry at him for taking substances or participating in activities that are harmful to him and others, you can focus on finding ways to support him.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>STEP 6: ADOPTING A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE APPROACH</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Our relatively new awareness of the significance childhood abuse has for addiction has changed the way professionals view substance dependence and compulsive behavior and, most importantly, how they treat those who are afflicted. While twelve-step programs are still the gold standard for many, numerous professionals now believe that the original wounding caused by childhood abuse or neglect must also be healed in order to successfully treat substance and activity dependencies.</p>
<p class="indent">The realization that those who suffer from dependencies also likely suffered trauma has created a new respect for the kind of trauma-sensitive treatment needed to facilitate recovery. A trauma-sensitive approach to substance and activity dependence includes <a id="page_70"/>understanding not only that many if not most people with dependencies suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex trauma, but also that their behavior is, as noted in step 5, actually an understandable attempt to cope with or adapt to overwhelming circumstances. This perspective encourages us to treat those who have dependency problems with more dignity, respect, and compassion—and to encourage them to treat themselves in the same way, making it a much more empowering approach.</p>
<p class="indent">Substance abuse professionals who are trauma informed take this understanding a step further: They have been educated or trained in the consequences of trauma, so they can understand, anticipate, and respond to the issues, expectations, and special needs of a person who has been victimized.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary goal of a trauma-sensitive or trauma-informed approach is to help those who suffer from substance problems gain a better understanding of the role that trauma has played in shaping their life. Specifically, this approach focuses on helping those who suffer from dependency recognize that many of the behaviors they are most critical of in themselves (and are criticized for by others) are actually coping mechanisms or attempts at self-regulation—using drugs or alcohol to cope with anxiety, for example, or to address self-soothing deficits.</p>
<p class="indent">The principles of a trauma-informed way of thinking include the following:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>The impact of trauma is total: It narrows the victim’s life, constricts choices, undermines self-esteem, takes away control, and creates a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Many behavioral “problems” that victims experience are actually adaptive responses to trauma. Symptoms—including troubling behaviors—should be seen as <i>adaptations</i> rather than <i>pathology</i>.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_71"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Every symptom helped a victim in the past and continues in some way to help in the present.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>The focus is on what happened to the person rather than on what is wrong with the person. Past abuses are linked to current coping strategies, and current symptoms are reframed as attempts to cope with past abuses.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Substance use and certain psychiatric symptoms may have evolved as coping strategies at a time when options were limited.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Those who suffer from an addiction are doing the best they can at any given time to cope with the life-altering and frequently shattering effects of trauma.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Adopting these same principles and beliefs will go a long way toward revising the way you perceive and treat your partner. Here’s how this new way of thinking will help both of you:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It <i>transforms him</i> from being “bad” to being wounded, which in turn opens the door for him to develop a more empathetic and constructive attitude toward himself.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It <i>externalizes the problem</i>. You can now view your addicted partner as basically good, with some problems that have intruded on his life but do not represent his core being. In other words, the symptoms are the problem, not the person.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It <i>normalizes the situation</i>. Both you and your partner may have felt that he is not normal, that he is bad, broken, sick. Trauma-informed thinking helps both of you see him as having normal and understandable reactions to unfortunate events.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It <i>emphasizes strengths and resources</i>. Because both you and your partner are likely to be critical of him, <a id="page_72"/>especially of the problematic ways he has sometimes behaved, it is important to look for his strengths and give him credit for them.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It <i>mobilizes him</i> (with your help) to discover healthier and more productive coping strategies.</p>
