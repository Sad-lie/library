<p class="noindent3"><b><small>IF YOU HAVE DECIDED TO BE YOUR PARTNER’S SUPPORTER, THIS</small></b> chapter will give you specific strategies to help you do so. But even if you have decided to become your partner’s collaborator, don’t skip ahead; the advice and strategies here will be very helpful to you. Think of this chapter as a primer or introduction for becoming a collaborator.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have decided, for whatever reason, that it is best for you and your partner if you don’t attempt to work directly with him as his collaborator, this chapter will guide you in becoming a compassionate supporter. We will share ways to create a compassionate environment—one that supports your partner emotionally. You will learn how to (1) view your partner in a more compassionate way, (2) express your anger in constructive ways instead of taking it out on your partner, and (3) minimize or even eliminate shaming behaviors. We will also teach you how to become more self-compassionate, since the more compassion you feel for yourself, the more you’ll have for your partner.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_128"/><b>CREATING A COMPASSIONATE ENVIRONMENT</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">By creating a compassionate environment around your partner, you encourage him to come out of denial by making him feel safer and more secure, which in turn will help him take the steps—and the risks—necessary to recover.</p>
<p class="indent">You can create this environment in several ways:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Soothe your partner’s hurts and comfort his pain.</i> Even if your partner does not share his suffering with you (or even denies he is suffering), an understanding look, a sigh, or a comforting touch can still communicate that <i>you are with him in his pain.</i> As we discussed in <a href="Chapter03.html">chapter 3</a>, this expression of compassion from you will help him feel less alone in his struggle to recover.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Work on being more empathetic toward your partner.</i> In other words, put yourself in his place and imagine how he feels. As impatient, disappointed, and angry at your partner as you sometimes feel, imagine how he must feel about himself. Yes, he may act as though he doesn’t care; he may become defensive and deny he has a problem. But beneath the wall he has built up, he is feeling deeply impatient, disappointed, and angry with himself. And he is feeling deeply ashamed of himself. (This is why it is so important for you to avoid shaming him further—we’ll discuss this later.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Provide the space for your partner to share his suffering with you</i> by not constantly complaining about how much you suffer because of him and his substance abuse. He is unlikely to feel open to admitting how much he suffers if he is constantly on the defensive, warding off attacks. (We’ll provide ways for you to release your anger later on in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_129"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Work on understanding your partner’s substance dependence</i>—including what caused it, and why it is so difficult to break. It is harder to have compassion for someone when we don’t understand why they behave as they do. You began this work in <a href="Chapter04.html">chapter 4</a>, but we encourage you to continue it.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Provide compassion for yourself.</i> The more compassionate you are with yourself about how you are suffering, the more compassionate you will be able to be with your partner. (We’ll offer you suggestions for how to go about this later on in this chapter as well.)</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>COMMON OBSTACLES TO CREATING A COMPASSIONATE ENVIRONMENT</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">No one said that creating a compassionate environment would be easy. And no matter how much you like the idea or how eager you are to begin creating this kind of environment, chances are there will be some obstacles in your way.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to create a compassionate environment you first need to feel compassionate toward your partner. Having compassion for someone means that you are moved by his pain, that you join him in his suffering, and that you feel the urge to help him in some way.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, those who have codependent tendencies sometimes have <i>too much</i> empathy or compassion for others, meaning that they think of others’ needs before their own, feel their partners’ suffering too much, and blur the boundaries between themselves and others, making others’ suffering their own. But you may still have a difficult time having compassion for your partner. You may feel compassion for those you consider to be blameless victims but have difficulty feeling it for those whose suffering stems from failures, personal weaknesses, or bad decisions. Instead of feeling compassion for your <a id="page_130"/>partner, you may close your heart to his suffering, telling yourself that he has brought it on himself.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have difficulty feeling your partner’s feelings, it can help to draw an association between your partner and yourself. The next time you see that your partner is suffering, try to remember a time when you suffered in a similar way.</p>
<p class="indent">Another strategy for increasing feelings of compassion toward your partner is to work on your self-compassion. Self-compassion is key to becoming more compassionate toward others, as it’s difficult to feel for your partner something you don’t feel for yourself. (We’ll offer more information on how to develop more self-compassion later in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="indent">Other frequent obstacles to creating a compassionate environment include:</p>

<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Taking your partner’s behavior personally</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Let’s discuss each of these obstacles, and how to get past them, in more detail.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Displaying Anger toward Your Partner</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The first and probably most powerful obstacle is anger and resentment toward your partner. After all, it is highly likely that you have been deeply hurt by your partner’s behavior. Things he has done (or left undone) have significantly affected your life and, if you have children, your children’s lives. Your partner has probably let you down in very painful ways, and you may feel deeply disappointed and betrayed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_131"/>In spite of your love for your partner, and in spite of your desire to help him, these feelings of resentment, anger, hurt, and betrayal can get in the way of experiencing compassion for him and creating the kind of environment you want to create. For this reason it is important for you to find a way to release this anger so that you can focus on being his supporter (or collaborator).</p>
<p class="indent">Consider any or all of the following healthy, constructive ways to vent your anger, depending on what speaks to you most:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Write a letter to your partner that you will not give to him. In the letter, tell him exactly how his substance abuse has affected you. Don’t hold back; let all your feelings of anger and hurt come out on the page. You may want to burn the letter or tear it up into tiny pieces afterward as a symbolic gesture of getting rid of your anger.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>When you are alone at home, talk out loud to yourself, expressing all the angry feelings you are having. Don’t censor yourself; say exactly what is on your mind in whatever kind of language you choose.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Imagine you are sitting across from your partner. Now imagine telling him exactly how his addiction has negatively affected you. Again, don’t hold back and don’t censor yourself.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Put your face in a pillow and scream as you think about how difficult your life has been for you thanks to your partner’s addiction.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>If you feel as though you need to release your anger physically, ask your body what it needs to do. You might get the sense that you need to hit, kick, push, break things, or tear things up. Honor that intuitive feeling by <a id="page_132"/>finding a way to do so in a safe but satisfying way—for example, kneeling down next to your bed and hitting it with your fists. If you are alone and no one is around, you can let out sounds as you hit. You can lie on your bed and kick your legs, or you can stomp on egg cartons or other packaging; you can tear up old telephone books, or go to a deserted place and throw rocks or bottles.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Know, also, that releasing your anger is an ongoing process, not a one-time thing. You have, no doubt, built up a tremendous mountain of anger over the years; getting rid of it will take time. Think of each episode of anger release as taking one more boulder off that mountain.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have difficulty giving yourself permission to get angry or fear losing control if you do so, refer to Beverly’s book <i>Honor Your Anger</i>.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Shaming Your Partner</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">One of the most powerful things you can do to support your partner in his recovery is to stop shaming him.</p>
<p class="indent">First, there is scientific evidence that shaming doesn’t work when it comes to changing someone’s behavior, and in fact causes more harm than good. Keep in mind that few people change in response to shame. When we shame someone, we alienate and isolate him, which tends to make him feel disconnected. The shamed person becomes angry and feels terrible about himself. An angry, disconnected person who hates himself has little motivation to change and is far more likely to continue his addictive behavior.</p>
<p class="indent-bs1">Second, as we’ve discussed, your partner is likely to be overwhelmed with shame already. Humiliating him further, making him out to be a selfish monster, will only cause him to remain defensive.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3m"><a id="page_133"/><b>T<small>HE</small> R<small>ELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</small> A<small>LCOHOLISM AND</small> S<small>HAME</small></b></h3>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span>Jessica Tracy and Daniel Randles at the University of British Columbia conducted a study to discover whether alcoholics’ feelings of shame about their addiction might actually interfere with their attempts to get sober. They recruited about a hundred women and men from AA meeting rooms—all with less than six months of sobriety—and measured their levels of shame and other emotions, along with certain personality traits.</p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>One reason shame has gone unstudied is that it is a very difficult emotion to capture. People who are experiencing shame tend to hide it and escape it, not talk about it openly. Tracy and Randles decided to measure the level of shame by noting participants’ body language. They asked their volunteers to describe the last time they drank and “felt bad about it.” They then videotaped their responses. Later, they analyzed and coded the volunteers’ body movements and postures as a measure of their shameful feelings. People who were ashamed act very much like submissive animals, slumping their shoulders and narrowing their chest. This physical display of shame may be universal, as it has been observed in both adults and children in many cultures.</p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>The scientists wanted to see whether this shameful body language correlated with mental and physical health and especially with successful sobriety four months later—the window of time in which most newly recovered alcoholics will relapse. Indeed, more than half of the volunteers never made it back to the lab at the four-month checkpoint. But for those who did, the researchers noted an unmistakable connection between shame and relapse. The alcoholics who were most ashamed about their last drink—typically a humiliating experience—were more likely to relapse. Their relapses were <a id="page_134"/>also more severe, involving much more drinking, and they were more likely to suffer other declines in health.</p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span>In short, feelings of shame do not appear to promote sobriety or protect against future problematic drinking—indeed, the opposite appears to be true.</p>
<p class="blockpi-l"><span class="hide">                  </span>This is the first scientific evidence to bolster what alcoholism counselors and recovering alcoholics have long known: <i>Shame is a core emotion underlying chronic heavy drinking</i>. Shame is what gets people into the rooms of AA—it defines the alcoholic “bottom”—but it’s not a good motivator for staying in recovery. The power of AA is that it offers something positive to replace that negative emotion that most alcoholics know all too intimately.<a id="rfn24"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>How to Stop Adding to His Stockpile of Shame</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">To create a compassionate environment, it is very important that you not add to your partner’s stockpile of shame. Shaming your partner only makes him feel worse about himself. Since your goal is to support him, you want to do everything you can to help him feel better about himself, not the opposite.</p>
<p class="indent">Letting go of shaming behavior can be difficult. It probably has become a habit—a way for you to release your frustration and anger at his behavior. But as you work on releasing your anger toward your partner in more constructive ways, you will find that you are less likely to want to shame your partner, which will make that habit easier to break.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to break the shaming habit, begin to notice how often you shame him with statements such as these:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I can’t believe you did it again. You promised me you wouldn’t. You have absolutely no willpower, do you?”</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“When are you going to grow up and start acting like a man?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_135"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“You’re such a loser.”</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“You’re a hopeless case. I feel sorry for you.”</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I don’t know why I stay with you. God knows no other woman would put up with this kind of crap!”</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“What’s wrong with you? You’re pathetic! Can’t you control yourself for even one day?”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When you catch yourself saying something shaming to your partner, take a moment and ask yourself, “What am I feeling right now? Why do I feel the need to shame my partner?” It may simply be that shaming him has become a habit—but that habit likely originated as a way for you to vent your anger or frustration or to avoid feeling deeper feelings of disappointment or hurt.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Feeling Sorry for Yourself</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">One reason for your anger at your partner and your tendency to shame him is that you desire validation and appreciation for all <i>you</i> have suffered because of his substance abuse.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, you are not likely to get this kind of validation from your partner. First of all, he probably feels too defensive or too ashamed to give it to you. Second, it is likely that your partner did not receive compassion or validation as a child and therefore doesn’t know how to give these things to others.</p>
<p class="indent">Other people may not be very forthcoming when it comes to offering you compassion, either. Friends and family may have advised you to leave your partner, and since you haven’t done so, they might have grown impatient with you. Or perhaps they are in denial about just how serious your partner’s problems are and expect you to stay with him no matter how bad it gets, offering no understanding for how much you have suffered.</p>
<p class="indent">It comes down to this: You need to provide for yourself the validation and compassion you need and deserve.</p>
<p class="indent-bs2"><a id="page_136"/>In addition to being the best way you can support your partner, compassion is the most powerful tool you have for helping yourself as you take on the role of supporter or collaborator. Self-compassion will help you remain strong even in the most difficult of times. It will help you bounce back from your partner’s inappropriate, embarrassing, hurtful, or abusive behavior. Most important, self-compassion will help motivate you to take care of yourself. Self-compassion encourages us to begin to talk to and treat ourselves with the same kindness and caring we would show a good friend or a beloved child.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3m"><b>S<small>ELF</small>-C<small>OMPASSION</small> D<small>EFINED</small></b></h3>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="blockp">If compassion is the ability to feel and connect with the suffering of another human being, self-compassion is the ability to feel and connect with <i>one’s own suffering.</i> Kristin Neff, professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, is the leading researcher in the growing field of self-compassion. In her book <i>Self-Compassion</i>, she defines self-compassion as “being open to and moved by one’s own suffering, experiencing feelings of caring and kindness toward oneself, taking an understanding, nonjudgmental attitude toward one’s inadequacies and failures, and recognizing that one’s experience is part of the common human experience.”<a id="rfn25"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="blockpi-l"><span class="hide">                  </span>If we are to be self-compassionate, we need to give ourselves the same gifts we offer to others for whom we express compassion. In other words, we need to offer ourselves the same <i>recognition</i>, <i>validation</i>, and <i>support</i> we would offer a loved one who is suffering.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="indent2">Most of us were raised to persevere despite difficulties. And while persevering is important, it’s also essential that we not ignore our feelings about how difficult something is, but rather acknowledge that difficulty and have compassion for it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_137"/>Stopping to acknowledge your suffering with self-compassion is not the same as whining, wallowing in self-pity, or feeling sorry for yourself. When we are experiencing self-pity we tend to complain, to ourselves and others, about how bad a situation is, while seeing ourselves as helpless to change it. There is often a bitter tone to our thoughts and feelings. Being angry about a situation or about what someone did to hurt you is fine, and even healing; it is when you allow bitterness and helplessness to cause you to dwell on how you’ve been victimized that you get stuck in self-pity.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are a partner of someone who has a substance abuse problem, you have suffered. There’s no denying that you’ve been hurt and embarrassed and angered by your partner’s behavior. You may have lost friends and money, your career may have suffered, and your health may have been affected since you have likely suffered both emotionally and physically. But self-pity doesn’t help you, and it can also prevent you from helping your partner. Self-compassion, on the other hand, helps you both.</p>
<p class="indent">Thinking and acting with self-compassion has been shown to have psychological benefits, including the reduction of negative feelings, such as distress, and increased well-being, optimism, and happiness.<a id="rfn26"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<div class="boxs">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Two of Beverly’s clients, with very similar circumstances, made the following two statements:</b></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="numbj">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“My whole life has been ruined by my husband’s alcoholism. We don’t have any friends anymore because he’s managed to anger or insult everyone. Our kids don’t bring their friends over anymore because they are too ashamed of him. I should leave him, but when he’s sober he’s a really good father. The whole situation just seems hopeless. I just feel angry and stuck. I resent him for putting me in this position.”</p>
<p class="numbj">2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I feel sad when I think of what my husband’s alcoholism has done to our family. The kids are embarrassed to bring anyone to the house, and most of our friends have <a id="page_138"/>become alienated from us because of his behavior. I feel stuck because I think I should leave him, but he is a good husband and father when he’s sober. I guess it is understandable that I would feel so stuck. After all, it is a difficult situation with no easy answers. I think I need some help so I can decide what to do.”</p>
</div>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>The woman in the first example is feeling a lot of resentment and bitterness. She seems to feel hopeless and to blame her husband for her own confusion about what to do. The tone of her statement is self-pitying.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>The woman in the second example also seems to feel hopeless, but she acknowledges that she feels sad, too. Her statement displays self-compassion. In it, she acknowledges her feelings, and this in itself can help her begin to feel better. Using the phrase “it is understandable” validates her experience without blaming herself or her husband.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Where the first woman is focused on saying “poor me,” the second woman, having validated her feelings, is focused outward on how she can get help.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Self-compassion can also lead to more proactive behavior. Once you’ve validated your feelings and your experience, you may feel motivated to improve your situation. Beverly often finds this to be the case with people who are currently being either emotionally or physically abused. Once they acknowledge their suffering and allow themselves to feel and express their emotions about the abuse, they often feel more impetus to leave the relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as connecting with the suffering of others has been shown to comfort and heal, connecting with our own suffering will do the same. The more you provide for yourself the compassion you so desperately need, the less inclined you will be to continually remind your partner of how much he has disappointed, embarrassed, and hurt you or how he has ruined his life. This is a crucial step toward creating a compassionate environment.</p>
<p class="indent-bs2"><a id="page_139"/>If you’d like to find out how self-compassionate you already are, go to <a href="http://www.self-compassion.org">www.self-compassion.org</a> and take the quiz. The site also offers some self-compassion practices you can perform in addition to the exercise below.</p>
<div class="boxg">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">BECOMING COMPASSIONATE TOWARD YOURSELF</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Think about the most compassionate person you have known—someone kind, understanding, and supportive of you. It may have been a teacher, a friend, a friend’s parent, or a relative. Think about how this person conveyed compassion toward you and how you felt in this person’s presence. Notice the feelings and sensations that come up with this memory. If you can’t think of someone in your life who has been compassionate toward you, think of a compassionate public figure, or even a fictional character from a book, film, or television show.</p>
<p class="indentb">Now imagine that you have the ability to become as compassionate toward yourself as this person has been toward you (or as you imagine this person would be toward you). See if you can single out what this person did that made you feel so cared about: the words, gestures, looks, or touches. Now use these to help you provide for yourself the things this person provided for you. Try talking to yourself in the same way, or using the same loving words or soothing tones. If the person physically comforted you, repeat this gesture toward yourself.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Taking Your Partner’s Behavior Personally</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">It can be difficult to not take your partner’s behavior personally. When he lies to you or blames you, it feels insulting and disrespectful. When he doesn’t come home, it feels as if he doesn’t care how worried you become. <i>If he loved me</i>, you may think, <i>he wouldn’t continue to abuse alcohol</i> (or gamble, or use pornography). But it is vital <a id="page_140"/>that you understand, and remind yourself whenever needed, that his inappropriate, hurtful, or abusive behavior most likely doesn’t say anything about how he feels about you. It does, however, say everything about how he feels about himself.</p>
<p class="indent">Your partner isn’t using because of you—because he’s trying to punish you, or because he wants to get even with you, or because he hates you. He may at times give these <i>excuses</i> for using, but they aren’t true. His dependence problems stem from his own issues and problems, not from who you are or even how he feels about you.</p>
<p class="indent">This may sound like a contradiction, because we are saying that your partner’s substance abuse doesn’t have anything to do with you, yet we are also telling you that your behavior can influence whether or not he stops using. The difference is this: While shaming him may cause him to become more defensive and less motivated, and may even give him an excuse in the moment to use, his compulsion to use a substance or an activity comes from deep inside himself. This compulsion is an attempt to soothe or take away the excruciating pain inside him, pain most likely originating in childhood trauma. If you stop shaming him, he won’t have that as an excuse to use and may have to look inside himself to discover the real reason he uses.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>MORE SUPPORTIVE STRATEGIES</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">It can take time and sometimes hard work to move past the obstacles in the way of creating a compassionate environment. But if you continue to work at it, following the advice and strategies offered here, you will find that you have created a supportive space that will benefit both you and your partner.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, creating a compassionate environment that encourages change is just one strategy for supporting your partner. Being supportive also involves <i>looking at things through your partner’s perspective</i> instead of only your own. This includes beginning to trust that even <a id="page_141"/>if you don’t agree with some of your partner’s choices regarding his recovery, you need to step back and <i>allow him to be in charge of his own process.</i></p>
<p class="indent">There are many legitimate paths to recovery, and your partner knows what will work for him better than you do. Although many people respond well to twelve-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, these programs don’t work for everyone. If your partner knows this about himself, you can support him by not trying to talk him into it. Offering options (instead of ultimatums) is a positive way to support him, but so is trusting that he will find the right option for himself. There is even evidence showing that there’s a good chance that your partner can get better without treatment, if he’s properly motivated. One national survey found that 24 percent of people diagnosed with alcohol dependence—the most severe category of alcohol problem—recovered <i>on their own within a year.</i><a id="rfn27"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Being supportive also includes these strategies:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Have supportive conversations</i> in which you openly listen when he feels remorse or guilt for what his substance dependence has caused him to do.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Encourage him to face the truth about his behavior.</i> This means that you do not “comfort” him by telling him things are not that bad. If he is feeling guilt or remorse for what he has done, this is a positive thing; it is when he recognizes the consequences of his substance dependency that he is closest to making a decision to change or to reach out for help. However, be sure that, while doing this, you also . . .</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Encourage him when he’s down.</i> If he begins shaming himself with statements like “I’m a loser” or “I’m worthless” or “I don’t deserve you and the kids,” don’t let <a id="page_142"/>him go on for too long. Listen compassionately when he is looking at his problems more realistically, and after he’s shared with you how bad he feels, say something supportive about him and his ability to change.</p>

<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>This is what Beverly’s client Judy said to her husband, who was recovering from a drug dependence, when he began to shame himself about his behavior in front of their children the last time he’d been high:</b></p>
<p class="block0s"><span class="hide">                  </span>Yes, it is true that you’ve embarrassed the kids, and this has caused them to lose respect for you. I can understand that knowing this is really painful. But I believe you can turn this thing around. I know you and I know how strong you are. If you really want to change, I know you can and I will be here every step of the way to encourage you. If you want we can talk about what options there are for treatment.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Judy’s statement didn’t negate what he’d done to hurt others, which is important. But instead of allowing him to shame himself, Judy <i>expressed empathy and compassion</i> with the words “I can understand.” She focused on his <i>feelings</i> versus letting him call himself names or demean himself. Then she offered support and encouragement in the form of letting him know she believed in him and believed he could change. Finally she offered to help in a concrete way, by talking about options.</p>

<p class="bull0"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Continue to change the way you think about substance use and compulsive behavior.</i> The more you understand about substance dependence, the more you will be able to change your way of thinking about it and become more compassionate and understanding and less critical and judgmental. We provided a great deal of information in <a href="Chapter04.html">chapter 4</a>, but we also recommend you do some further <a id="page_143"/>reading, such as Chris’s book <i>Recover to Live</i>, and <i>Beyond Addiction</i> by Jeffrey Foote, Carrie Wilkens, and Nicole Kosanke.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Understand why your partner uses.</i> Gaining a better understanding of what benefits the substance or compulsive behavior provides him will help you have more empathy toward him. It may also help you identify how you can modify your behavior, your relationship, and the environment to better support his long-term change. (We provide more information and an exercise to help with this in the next chapter.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Learn all you can about what motivates a person to change.</i> Put simply: <i>Motivation for change occurs whenever the costs of a behavior perceptibly outweigh the benefits.</i> While you can’t motivate your partner to change, by understanding his motivations better—both his motivation to use substances, as discussed above, and his motivation to change—you can better support him when he is motivated. Understanding his motivation will also help you avoid feeling excessive disappointment when he wavers in his attempts to change. (We provide a strategy to learn more about your partner’s motivations in the next chapter. There is also an excellent section on motivation in <i>Beyond Addiction</i>.)</p>
<p class="bull-bs2"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Understand that when you help yourself, you help your partner.</i> Be as willing to change your own unhealthy attitudes and behaviors as you want your partner to be. By taking care of your physical and emotional health, by improving your resilience, and by putting social supports in place, you not only set a good example but also ensure you have the internal and external resources <a id="page_144"/>you’ll need to successfully help your partner. (See <a href="Chapter10.html">chapter 10</a> for more information about self-care.)</p>

<p class="blockp">In order to fully support your partner, you need to know not just what you can do, but also what you <i>can’t</i> do, if you want to help him. Remind yourself that:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="blockn"><span class="hide">              </span>1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You can’t change your partner.</p>
<p class="blockn"><span class="hide">              </span>2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You can’t make your partner want to change.</p>
</div>
<p class="blockpi-l"><span class="hide">                  </span>What you can do is help your partner realize that he wants to change by helping reduce his need to defend his current behavior.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">YOUR PLAN FOR BEING YOUR PARTNER’S SUPPORTER</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Refer to all the information we’ve shared so far and write up a personal plan of action using the suggestions that most resonate with you. For example, you may see your role as his supporter consisting of being less judgmental and more compassionate toward him, being his “cheerleader,” and working on not taking his dependency issues personally.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="imageb"><img alt="" height="2" src="images/line.jpg" width="113"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Remember: Often, what looks like an unwillingness to change is a defensive stance. Those with substance problems respond with significantly less resistance when they are treated with kindness, <a id="page_145"/>compassion, and respect. Your job as your partner’s compassionate supporter is to provide those things.</p>
<p class="indent">This in itself is an enormous task, and you need to give yourself a great deal of self-acknowledgment for attempting it. It’s also a role that should not be minimized. Although your partner’s recovery is ultimately his responsibility, he desperately needs your support and encouragement if he is going to be successful.</p>
