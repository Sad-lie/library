<p class="centers"><i>“If everyone received the encouragement they need to grow, the genius in most everyone would blossom and the world would produce abundance beyond our wildest dreams.”</i></p>
<p class="centersa">—S<small>IDNEY</small> M<small>ADWED</small></p>
<p class="noindent3"><b><small>SO FAR WE’VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT <i>NOT</i> TO DO TO HELP</small></b> your partner on his road to recovery—shaming him, enabling him by fixing his mistakes or trying to protect him, using harsh words or tones that only lead to defensiveness. Now let’s talk about what <i>to</i> do.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter focuses on specific actions you can take by becoming either your partner’s <i>supporter</i> or his <i>collaborator,</i> and which role is likely to be right for you and your partner. In either case, your goal is to bring out the best in your partner, not the worst. This will require an attitude of acceptance, understanding, and compassion. You want to let your partner know that you are behind him and that you trust him to know what he needs and what is going to work for him.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_116"/><b>SUPPORTER OR COLLABORATOR: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The primary difference between being your partner’s supporter versus his collaborator is the degree of your involvement in his recovery process.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of supporter is more passive. In fact, you can be your partner’s supporter without ever telling him you are doing so. All you need to do is engage in behavior that is supportive, encouraging, and compassionate as he works toward recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of collaborator is more active and can be done only with your partner’s agreement. It includes engaging in supportive behaviors but may also involve you and your partner sitting down together to discuss treatment options or even going as far as working together on a treatment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at both of these roles in more detail, pulling together everything we’ve discussed so far.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Defining Supportive Behavior</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Supportive behavior is any action on your part that will support your partner in his own efforts to recover. In most situations, it doesn’t mean doing things for him, but rather letting go of control and allowing him to experience the consequences of his actions, learn from them, and make changes accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent">Supporting your partner doesn’t involve nagging him to do things, criticizing him, blowing up, or giving him the silent treatment when he behaves badly. Instead, supportive behavior includes:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Getting out of his way.</i> This means not providing him with excuses to blame you for his substance problems and not sidetracking him in unproductive arguments or blaming sessions.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_117"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Staying connected to him.</i> The research is clear that partner and family involvement in helping a loved one struggling with substances increases the odds of improvement and helps maintain positive changes. Remaining connected allows you to be present to notice and reinforce his positive changes.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Treating him with patience, compassion, kindness, and respect.</i> Even if you have lost some respect for your partner because of his past behaviors, he still deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Letting your partner know that you are on his side.</i> Show him by your words, your looks, and your actions that you are not his enemy; you are not trying to make him look or feel bad or trying to sabotage his efforts. You want him to heal, you want him to be happy, and you want him to succeed.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Defining Collaborative Behavior</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">To collaborate is to work together to perform a task and to achieve shared goals—in this case, your partner’s recovery and the healing of your relationship. Working together collaboratively lets you access greater resources and therefore reap greater rewards.</p>
<p class="indent">In a collaborative relationship you are walking the path together, each doing your part. In this case, though you are working together toward your partner’s recovery, you must still take your cues from him. After all, it is his journey.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as there is a fine but very distinct line between codependency and compassion, there is an equally fine but distinct line between enabling and being a collaborator. When we find ourselves trying to fix another person’s problems or needing to help them for our own sense of identity, then we are enabling or rescuing. The message you <a id="page_118"/>want to relay is “I see you are doing well. Is there anything you need from me?” instead of “You’re not doing it right. Here, do it this way!” or, even worse, “You’re not doing it right. Let me do it.”</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the supportive behaviors already mentioned, here are some good examples of actions you can take as a collaborator:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Agree to resolve potential problems and sticky situations together.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Agree to practice techniques around reinforcement and consequences. (We’ll outline some of these in <a href="Chapter08.html">chapter 8</a>.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Learn all you can about the many treatment options. That way, if and when your partner is ready to talk about reaching out for help, you can offer him some suggestions. (For a detailed list of treatment options, refer to <a href="Appendix2.html">Appendix II</a>.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Work with your partner to create a treatment plan that works for him.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>DECIDING HOW YOU WILL HELP</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Your decision to be a supporter or a collaborator doesn’t have to be an either-or thing. Many of the suggestions for being a compassionate supporter also apply to being your partner’s collaborator. And you might start out being a supporter and later decide with your partner that you should move into a collaborator role.</p>
<p class="indent">For now, focus on the role that seems right for you based on your present circumstances. Consider these elements to help you decide:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Your partner’s willingness to include you in his recovery.</i> You may feel ready and able to be a full-fledged collaborator in your partner’s recovery, but if he does <a id="page_119"/>not want your help, you will only be able to provide compassionate support from the sidelines. Some partners welcome their mate’s active interest and participation in their recovery and some do not. It has to be his choice.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Your willingness and ability to focus on your own healing.</i> In other words, how much work do you need to do on yourself? Since your time and energy are limited, it makes no sense for you to devote yourself to his recovery if it means ignoring your own. If you have any of the important issues outlined in <a href="Chapter05.html">chapter 5</a> that you need to focus on, you may not be a good candidate to become a collaborator—but you can still be a great supporter.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>How good you are at taking care of your own needs.</i> If you aren’t doing a very good job of taking care of your own needs, you probably shouldn’t try to focus on meeting the needs of your partner. Start by discovering which of your needs are unmet and on beginning to meet them; we’ll give you some exercises to help with this in <a href="Chapter10.html">chapter 10</a>. Once you are doing a better job of taking care of yourself, you can then revisit the idea of becoming your partner’s collaborator.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Determining Your Willingness and Ability to Take Care of Your Own Needs</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Many in the recovery movement believe that the primary way a loved one can help a substance abuser is to first take care of herself. In <i>Recover to Live,</i> Chris advises people in a relationship with an addict to “go take care of yourself and you will change everything . . . You <a id="page_120"/>have to focus on yourself. You must take care of yourself. When you do that, everything changes in the family system.”<a id="rfn23"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But, as we’ve said here, there really is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to recovery for the substance-dependent person or his partner. Yes, it is important that you take care of yourself—vitally important. Yes, it is important that you address your own issues and eventually address your relationship dynamics. But you don’t have to choose one or the other—to focus on yourself or to focus on your partner and your relationship. You can do both—really, all three—simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indent">Later in the book we’ll look at how to begin addressing and healing your own issues. For now, the important question is whether you’re proficient enough at basic self-care tasks, as well as self-nurturing and setting reasonable expectations for yourself, to be an effective collaborator. You can’t expect your partner to meet all your needs for companionship, affection, or encouragement while he is focusing on his recovery. It will take all his energy and focus to continue struggling to rid himself of his substance dependence. If you can’t give yourself what you need, trying to help your partner will only make things worse for you both.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Chris:</b> Recovery has taught me that if I find something wrong in my world, I need to look at me. I had a sponsor in a twelve-step program who used to say to me, “I have only one problem in my life and I’m it.” The first step toward helping your partner is to help yourself. You must put on your own life jacket first if you want any hope of saving him or yourself. If you stay without treating your own issues and initiating your own recovery, you will both drown in misery. If your partner has an active addiction—if he’s already in the deep end—throw him a rope, but don’t get in with him. He’ll pull you down.</i></p>

<p class="noindentb">Take a look at your answers to the odd-numbered statements. If you answered “true” to most of these questions, you are doing a good job of taking care of yourself.</p>
<p class="indentb">If you answered “false” to many of the odd-numbered questions and “true” to many of the even-numbered questions, taking <a id="page_122"/>care of yourself is something you struggle with, and it probably would not be a good idea for you to become your partner’s collaborator at this time.</p>
<p class="indentb">Former victims of abuse or neglect are especially at risk of becoming disconnected from or numb to their feelings and needs. They may not feed themselves when their body needs fuel because they are numb to the feelings of hunger. They may not allow themselves to cry or to seek out someone to talk to because they do not recognize when they are feeling sad or lonely. For this reason, if you are a former victim of abuse or neglect, exercise extra caution when it comes to choosing to be your partner’s collaborator.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4"><b>When It Isn’t Possible for You to Be His Collaborator</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to self-care issues, there are specific cases in which it may not be possible for you to become your partner’s collaborator and will require you to remain in the role of supporter. These can include:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>When your partner refuses to admit that he has a problem.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>When your partner’s behavior triggers an extreme negative reaction in you, either because of childhood issues or because of strong moral beliefs on your part (for example, if he is addicted to porn and you are a victim of sexual abuse or against pornography of any kind).</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>When your partner’s behavior gets in the way of your own recovery (for example, you have been clean and sober for years but your husband’s increased use of alcohol leaves you resentful).</p>

<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="noindents-bs1"><a id="page_123"/><b>Beverly’s client Janet is a good example of someone who could not be a collaborator because of the way her partner’s behavior intersected with her own childhood issues:</b></p>
<p class="block0s"><span class="hide">                  </span>I’ve recently discovered that my husband is addicted to pornography—the kind you can access on the internet. I feel so embarrassed about even saying that. And when I think about him watching that garbage it makes me feel physically ill. I felt betrayed.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Janet caught her husband watching it one night when she got up to go to the bathroom. When she confronted him he told her the pornography had come up automatically. But because she had watched a TV program on pornography, Janet knew this couldn’t be true. Her husband finally admitted that he had gone on a site and that he used it as a form of stress reduction so he could relax and go to sleep.</p>
<p class="blocksi-bs1"><span class="hide">                  </span>A few days later, once Janet had calmed down, she talked with her husband about other ways he could handle stress. She asked him if he had a problem with the frequency of sex between them, and he assured her that he was happy with their sex life and that there was no problem between them. He also promised he would stop viewing porn, but she later checked his history on the computer and discovered he had continued. She went ballistic and told him that unless he stopped she would end the relationship.</p>
<p class="block00s"><span class="hide">                  </span>He knows I was sexually abused as a child and that just the thought of pornography pushes all my buttons. The thought of him watching it makes him repulsive to me—almost the way I feel when I think of a child molester. The whole thing feels sleazy to me—him watching it and masturbating to the images, and hiding it from me—it is just too close to the associations I have with sexual abuse.</p>
<p class="block0si-bs1"><span class="hide">                      </span>I’m sorry to say that I’ve lost respect for him and I no longer trust him. I don’t know if I can believe what he says anymore, and I’m not even sure if he’s doing other things behind my back. I just don’t feel I can live with this.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span><a id="page_124"/>As Beverly explained to Janet, sometimes it doesn’t matter how much you love your partner, no matter how much compassion and understanding you have for him, there can be a limit as to what you are willing or capable of doing.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Although not in a formal way, Janet had actually started out being a compassionate collaborator with her husband. She had the right idea when she talked to him about finding alternative ways of relieving his stress. This is actually one of the first steps to creating a collaborative relationship with your partner—talking about reasons for the dependency and discussing other ways to meet his needs.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>It was also a good idea for her to inquire about whether their sex life was fulfilling for him. Partners tend to take the compulsive behavior of their partners personally, so it’s good to check it out. If he had told her there was a problem, it could have opened the door to working on their sexual relationship.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>But while Janet had good intentions and had even taken some positive steps toward collaborating with her husband on his problem, her own issues were getting in the way. Try as she might, she couldn’t get past her repulsion toward him or the sense of betrayal she felt since he knew how his continued behavior affected her.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>In other words, her own issues prevented her from having compassion for her partner—compassion that was necessary if she was going to be able to help him. Janet would have had to essentially sacrifice her own health and well-being in order to support her husband in his recovery.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Even though Janet’s husband had agreed to go into psychotherapy to figure out why he had become compulsive about pornography, this didn’t help Janet much. She had lost so much trust in him that she didn’t feel optimistic about him being honest enough in therapy for him to really get help.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Beverly advised Janet to continue therapy, either with her or with someone else, in order to help her work through her feelings of anger, humiliation, betrayal, and pain. She also needed a safe place to continue processing the sexual abuse she had experienced at the hands of her grandfather when she was a child, a man she had also loved and trusted but who had betrayed her trust.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span><a id="page_125"/>Eventually, Janet was able to separate her feelings for her grandfather from her feelings toward her husband. Still, she could not tolerate her husband’s behavior. Since they had children and she didn’t want to disrupt their lives, Janet decided to tell her husband that for the time being he had to sleep in their guest room. She made it clear that she could not sleep in the same bed with him and that she certainly could not have sex with him. Because of the circumstances, it was clear Janet would not at any point be able to collaborate with her husband in his recovery.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h40"><b>Can You Be “All In”?</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The final consideration in choosing to be your partner’s collaborator versus his supporter is whether you can be “all in.”</p>
<p class="indent">Being all in means that you have considered the situation very carefully and have committed to staying with your partner and helping him with his recovery. It’s okay if you can make that commitment for only a certain amount of time, such as six months or a year, but you do need to commit. If you go into this process feeling defeated and assuming it is not going to work (because nothing has before), or questioning whether you can actually help, that negativity can doom both your and your partner’s efforts from the beginning. Your partner needs to know that you feel optimistic about the process—and that you believe in him.</p>
<p class="indent">Being all in also requires you to take a hiatus from arguing, coercing, blaming, and other behaviors that often become habit for partners of substance- or activity-dependent people. You can’t expect your partner to believe that you are a compassionate collaborator who is there to support him if you are angry, impatient, or critical.</p>
<p class="indent">This doesn’t mean that you won’t get angry along the way when he fails to keep a commitment or when he slips into old behaviors. What it means is that you learn to express your disappointment, anger, and frustration in more constructive ways, away from him, and <a id="page_126"/>that you take responsibility for your feelings by practicing the methods of release in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that we’ve discussed what role you are going to play in your partner’s recovery—supporter or collaborator—let’s look more closely at some strategies for each.</p>
