<h2 class="h2c1"><a href="Contents.html#rch10"><b>Creating Your Own Self-Care Program</b></a></h2>
<p class="centers"><i>“Self-nurturing means, above all, making a commitment to self-compassion.”</i></p>
<p class="centers">—J<small>ENNIFER</small> L<small>OUDEN</small>, <i>The Woman’s Comfort Book</i></p>
<p class="noindent3"><small><b>FOLLOWING THE ADVICE AND STRATEGIES OFFERED IN THE LAST</b></small> few chapters means you will be focusing a great deal of attention on your partner and his recovery. But as you help your partner recover, it’s important to take care of your own needs as well. Otherwise you run the risk of “losing yourself” in your partner and his problems, or at the very least getting burnt out and not being able to be there for him.</p>
<p class="indent">Supporting or collaborating with your partner in his recovery process isn’t easy. You may feel good one day because your partner is doing well and bad another day when he slips up. But this gives your partner and your relationship too much power over your emotions and your life. You need to have a separate life, and that includes focusing some of your energy on taking care of yourself.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_170"/>When you take care of yourself, you build the emotional strength needed to accept what you can’t change about your partner and to weather the ups and downs of his recovery process. And by caring for yourself—including taking the time and space to work on any issues of your own—you also model healthy behaviors for your partner and contribute to a healthier atmosphere in your home.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s why we’ve chosen to end this book with a chapter that helps you create a personalized self-care program.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="Chapter04.html">chapter 4</a> we discussed the benefits of viewing your partner in a trauma-sensitive way. But partners of those who suffer from substance or activity dependence can benefit from viewing <i>themselves</i> in a trauma-sensitive way as well. As we’ve discussed, partners are often dependent themselves—on taking care of, rescuing, and making excuses for their partners, or on being in control of people and things outside themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding codependency as a behavior—or, rather, a pattern of behaviors—that helps you cope with trauma or negative feelings can grow your self-understanding and the self-compassion that comes with it. It can also help highlight the importance of taking the self-care steps necessary to feel comforted and more in control of yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">For some of you, creating a personalized self-care program may be a fairly easy task. You may need only the suggestions we make and the exercises we offer as reminders for you to focus more on your own needs. But for others this will be a more difficult chapter. It can be painful to realize that you don’t know what you need and that even when you do, you don’t know how to go about providing these things for yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">This is especially true if your needs were ignored or neglected when you were a child or if you were made to feel you were being “selfish” if you focused on them.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Chris</b>: I grew up in an environment where the ethic was public service—doing for others who were less fortunate, giving</i> <a id="page_171"/><i>back, and making a difference in the world by getting out of yourself and helping somebody else. There was no room for self-examination. Addressing one’s own feelings was thought to be a waste of time; people were uncomfortable with it. Most folks don’t like self-examination because they fear it will reveal aspects of themselves and their lives they would rather not see.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>However, my instinct growing up was to examine what was happening inside myself as well as outside. The inner journey has always held more gravitas and meaning for me. I came into this world with the belief that if you change yourself for the better, you can change the world for the better. Writing my memoir was my coming out, my public emancipation from the ethic that avoidance of the inner struggle was most useful. And I was not disappointed; it led to my emancipation from much of my family legacy that didn’t serve me, as well as delivering me to my work as an advocate for those struggling with addiction around the world. But it took a lot of work to get there.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If your needs or feelings were ignored or neglected, take notice of any resistance you have to our suggestions and offer yourself self-compassion instead of criticism and impatience. For example, say to yourself, “It is understandable that I would find it difficult to focus on my own needs because I was raised to focus on the needs of others.”</p>
<p class="indent">As you read this chapter, feel free to pick and choose which suggestions feel most helpful to you in creating your own individualized plan for self-care.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>RESILIENCE, NEEDS, AND SELF-AWARENESS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Resilience is the ability to maintain equanimity, health, strength, and happiness after a crisis, setback, or disappointment. It is the ability to bend without breaking, or bounce back, in the face of a challenge. <a id="page_172"/>Although you cannot control your partner and, for the most part, you cannot control what challenges you will face on a daily basis, there are things you can do to help control the way you respond to both. By making sure you take care of your needs, from the most basic (food and rest) to things like companionship and stimulation, you can reduce your vulnerability to bad moods, lost tempers, and meltdowns.</p>
<p class="indent">The first step to being able to take care of your needs is self-awareness—that is, knowing what your needs are by being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and physical state. According to Daniel Goleman in his groundbreaking book, <i>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</i>: “Self-awareness—recognizing a feeling as it happens—is the keystone of emotional intelligence [and] crucial to psychological insight and understanding . . . People with greater certainty about their feelings are better pilots of their lives, having a surer sense of how they really feel about personal decisions.”</p>
<p class="indent-bs2">Connecting with your emotions is an essential step in connecting with your real self. Unless you know what you are feeling at any given moment, you are not in touch with who you are. It is also one of the most effective ways of moving from an external focus (people and tasks outside yourself) to an internal one. Feelings—good and bad—provide us with valuable information that can give us clues as to what our needs are, whether they are being met, and, if not, how we can meet them.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">CONNECTING FEELINGS WITH NEEDS</h4>
<p class="noindentb">The following exercise will help you make the important connection between feelings and needs:</p>
<p class="numb">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Check in with yourself several times a day by asking yourself what you’re feeling.</i> It’s easier at first to stick <a id="page_173"/>with the four basic feelings of anger, sadness, fear, and guilt/shame. Ask yourself, “Am I feeling angry?” If the answer is no, move on to “Am I feeling sad?” and so on. (Of course, you may find that your answer to “What am I feeling?” is something else entirely, like “lonely” or “hungry.”)</p>
<p class="numb">2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>When you find a feeling, look for the corresponding need.</i> Ask yourself, “What do I need?” Answer in the simplest way rather than confusing the issue with too many details or complexities.</p>
<p class="numbi"><span class="hide">           </span>Often the answer will be “I just need to feel my feeling and then let it fade.” But if you feel angry, you may need to speak up for yourself. If you feel sad, you may need to cry. If you feel hungry, you need food. If you feel guilty, you may need to apologize.</p>
<p class="numbi"><span class="hide">           </span>You might have to “try on” several needs before you find the one that’s true for you in any given moment. You may also have many needs attached to a single feeling. For example, if you feel <i>lonely</i>, you may <i>need</i> to call a friend, to get a hug from your partner, or to connect with yourself—or all three.</p>
<p class="numb">3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Be on the alert for answers that are not truly responsive to your needs.</i> Some examples are “I feel sad, so I need some candy” or “I feel angry, so I need to hit him.” Ask yourself, “What do I <i>really</i> need?” The best answer might be “to express myself” (write, sing), “to get physical” (walk, stomp), “to develop a plan,” or “to learn from the experience for next time.”</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent1">Another important aspect of discovering what you need is becoming clear about what makes you feel happy, comfortable, and at peace, which the following exercises will help you focus on. Only when you know what makes you feel good can you begin to provide it for yourself!</p>

<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">YOUR FEEL-GOOD JOURNAL</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Buy a journal or create a folder on your computer and begin to jot down when you are feeling especially good—physically, emotionally, or spiritually. Pay particular attention to the circumstances surrounding these good feelings. You may notice that when you are with a certain person—a friend or loved one—you feel especially open and loving. Note this in your journal. You may notice that certain things in your environment make you feel happy—such as looking at the ocean, watching a sunset, seeing beautiful flowers, or being around animals. Write it down. You may also notice that when you act a certain way you end up feeling really good about yourself—for example, when you take the risk of being honest with someone, when you put your criticism of someone aside and feel real compassion for the person, or when you stop to give yourself credit for accomplishing something difficult. Write it down. Then periodically go back and read your Feel-Good Journal as a reminder to repeat these activities.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>WHY YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE CONNECTING WITH YOUR FEELINGS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you experienced constant chaos in the home as you were growing up, as is often the case in alcoholic families, emotions may be frightening things for you. If you witnessed your parents’ emotions getting out of hand or if you got yelled at, pushed around, or hit when a parent was angry, you may have come to fear emotions. And <a id="page_176"/>if you were ridiculed, punished, or abandoned when you got angry or started to cry, you may have learned to deny and repress your true emotions. Despite appearances, some people who are extremely emotional, including those who are eruptive or volatile, often respond so strongly only because they are denying more vulnerable feelings underneath. Those with a history of neglect or abuse also tend to be overwhelmed and controlled by their emotions; it can feel as if their emotions have become their enemies.</p>
<p class="indent">Dysfunctional behaviors, including abusive or victim-like patterns, codependency, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies, are often attempts to cope with intolerably painful emotions. Many people with codependent behavior patterns try to regulate their emotions, attempting to make themselves not feel whatever it is that they feel. This can be a direct result of an emotionally invalidating environment—one that mandates that people should smile even when they are unhappy, be nice and not rock the boat when they are angry, and beg for forgiveness even when they don’t feel they did anything wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">If as a child your feelings weren’t honored, you may have stopped feeling them—to the point that you now have trouble feeling or identifying emotions as an adult. If your feelings weren’t validated, you may have difficulty believing even today that you have the right to them. Because of this, you may often feel sideswiped by your own emotions, or overwhelmed when they build up. This in turn may cause you to project your feelings onto others—for instance, accusing your partner of being angry with you when, in actuality, you are the one who is angry with him.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, you may be unaware of what you are feeling at any given time. This lack of awareness makes it difficult for you to cope with any feelings that suddenly erupt in you. Since you don’t know what you need, you will be unable to communicate your needs to others. This means you will end up doing things you don’t want to do, being around people you don’t really care for, and, in terms of your partner, putting up with behavior you shouldn’t put up with.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_177"/>One possible reason for this disconnection is trauma experienced in childhood, whether abandonment, neglect, abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual), or loss of a loved one. Children (and adults) shut off their feelings, or <i>dissociate,</i> in response to traumatic situations. This dissociation can be experienced as feeling “spaced out” or dizzy, or feeling a floating sensation, as if the ground is slipping away. Some experience it as a feeling of detachment, as if their mind goes somewhere else and they are disconnected from their body. Others experience it as a feeling of mental or emotional numbness or deadness, or simply a lack of connection with themselves—which is exactly what it is.</p>
<p class="indent-bs2">Some people experienced so much trauma, chaos, or unpredictability in their childhood (for example, if their parents were constantly fighting, or they never knew when an alcoholic parent would suddenly have a violent outburst) that they developed a habit of dissociating. As adults they slip into a dissociative state whenever there is the slightest hint of upset. If you tend to dissociate as a result of traumatic childhood experiences, you will need to practice the following grounding exercise on a regular basis in order to break your habit of dissociating and bring yourself back to the present moment.</p>
<div class="boxg">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">GROUNDING PRACTICE</h4>
<p class="numb">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed or distracted.</p>
<p class="numb">2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Sit up in a chair or on a couch. Put your feet flat on the ground. (If you are wearing shoes with heels, take them off.)</p>
<p class="numb">3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>With your eyes open, take a few deep breaths. Turn your attention to feeling the ground under your feet. continue breathing and feeling your feet flat on the ground throughout the exercise.</p>
<p class="numb">4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Now, as you continue breathing, take a look around the room, scanning slowly, making sure you are actually seeing <a id="page_178"/>what is around you. Notice the colors, shapes, and textures of the objects in the room. If you’d like, turn your head as you scan for a wider view.</p>
<p class="numb">5.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>When your attention wanders, bring your focus back to feeling the ground under your feet as you continue to breathe and to notice the colors, shapes, and textures of the objects in the room.</p>
<p class="numb">6.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>After you have grounded yourself, you can reassure yourself that you are safe by reminding yourself that the traumatic event is not occurring now. You can say to yourself, “I’m safe now. I’m in the present and everything is okay.”</p>
<p class="indentb1">This grounding practice serves several purposes: It brings your awareness back to your body, which can stop you from dissociating. It returns you to the present, in case a trigger has catapulted you into the past. And it deliberately focuses your attention elsewhere, which allows strong feelings and thoughts to subside to the point where they are not dominating your experience.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>MEETING YOUR OWN NEEDS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you are going through a hard time while supporting or collaborating with your partner, instead of obsessing about what your partner did or did not do, ask yourself what you need in order to cope with the situation. Write down what you can provide for yourself (as opposed to what you want or need from your partner). For example, if your partner comes home after a night out drinking and criticizes you, instead of thinking, “What I need is for him to apologize to me for the way he talked to me,” try focusing on how you can make yourself feel better: “What I need is to remind myself that I am not the things he says I am. Then I need to talk to myself in a loving, kind way and remind myself of my positive qualities.”</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_179"/><b>BASIC SELF-CARE STRATEGIES</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The following list of basic self-care strategies may seem self-evident. Eat, drink, sleep—of course we all know we need to do these things. Yet the partners of those dependent on substances or activities often put even the most basic self-care needs on the back burner, especially when stressed or in the midst of a crisis (such as your partner getting arrested for drunk driving).</p>
<p class="indent">It’s easy to tell yourself that you will start an exercise program or catch up on your sleep in the <i>future</i>—when you have more time, when the crisis is over. But self-care is not a luxury to be deferred until your partner is handling things better; it is something you need to do <i>now</i> to make things better for both of you.</p>
<p class="indent">These are the most basic—and most necessary—self-care strategies:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Eat regular meals of nutritious food.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Drink plenty of water—not diet cola or coffee, but water.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Get plenty of sleep.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Get regular exercise.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Reach out for connection and companionship when you feel isolated and lonely.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Provide yourself with healthy sexual outlets. This includes masturbation, especially if your partner is unable or unwilling to engage in sexual activity with you or you do not feel close enough to him to engage in sex with him.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Provide yourself with adequate stimulation. Get involved in activities that fuel your mind, body, and spirit.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Satisfy your need for spiritual sustenance, whether in the form of contemplation, gratitude, prayer, ritual, study, or some other expression.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_180"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Take care of your medical needs, including visiting your doctor for well visits and treating illness (taking medications as prescribed, staying home and resting when sick).</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>MANAGING YOUR TRIGGERS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another important aspect of self-care is learning what your triggers are and finding ways to manage them.</p>
<p class="indent">A trigger is anything that sets off a memory or flashback that transports a person to the event of the original trauma. This is a normal occurrence for those who suffer from PTSD. When a person is “triggered,” he or she reacts spontaneously and intensely, often without realizing what caused the reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The following is a list of the most common triggers experienced by those who suffered neglect or abuse in childhood:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Perceived abandonment.</i> If you had childhood experiences with abandonment or neglect, you may be acutely sensitive to any hint of perceived abandonment by your partner and likely react powerfully and sometimes violently. For example, even the slightest hint of disapproval from your partner can trigger powerful feelings of rejection. When you see your partner laughing and being happy with someone else, you may feel certain that he is having an affair or that he is planning to leave you for her.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Feeling criticized.</i> If you were regularly criticized or shamed by your parents or other authority figures, you may react very intensely if you feel criticized today. This <a id="page_181"/>may happen for several reasons. First of all, you may carry around a great deal of shame, so whenever you are criticized you become overwhelmed with shame. Another reason you may be triggered by criticism is that you may see things in all-or-nothing terms, and when you are criticized it can make you feel shame for being “all bad.” Finally, criticism can feel like rejection and can therefore trigger a fear of abandonment. Your thinking may go like this: <i>If you don’t like something I’ve done, it means you don’t like me and you are going to abandon me</i>.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Feeling that others are unpredictable.</i> If you grew up in an environment where there was a great deal of chaos or inconsistency, you may have a great need for consistency and predictability, especially from those close to you. This can be true even if you are often unpredictable yourself. When you experience a person or situation as being inconsistent or unpredictable, this may cause you to be fearful and anxious. This particular trigger can also trigger a fear of abandonment, since unpredictability often goes hand in hand with rejection or abandonment.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Feeling invalidated or dismissed.</i> If your feelings were not validated when you were growing up, you may not have developed a strong sense of self, so you may be especially sensitive to comments or attitudes that are invalidating or dismissive. Comments like “You’re overreacting” or “You shouldn’t feel like that” serve to deny your feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Envy.</i> If your parents seemed to favor a sibling over you, you may be overwhelmed with feelings of envy when someone else receives special recognition. This <a id="page_182"/>can cause you to feel depressed or to act out in order to draw attention to yourself. This can happen during celebrations when all the attention is focused on someone else or even during a crisis when someone else needs the support of others. For example, instead of being supportive when your partner is grieving the death of a family member, you may criticize him for being too needy or you may even create another crisis so that your partner will be forced to take care of you.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Feeling smothered.</i> If you had overly controlling or overly protective parents, or if you had an emotionally needy parent who expected you to meet his or her emotional (or sexual) needs, you may be triggered whenever someone invades your physical or emotional space, demands something you don’t feel equipped or willing to supply, or pressures you for sex or affection.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Ask yourself if it is possible that you become triggered when any of these situations arise. Sometimes what upsets you most about your partner’s behavior is that what he said or did reminds you of another time and place—often something from your childhood. For example, imagine that your husband doesn’t come home for dinner (again). In addition to sparking feelings of disappointment, anger, or fear because of the present situation (you want your husband to eat dinner with the family since he doesn’t spend enough time with the children; you are afraid he has been in an accident), it may have triggered memories of your father not coming home, your mother ranting about it for hours, and the violent arguments that ensued once he got home.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you realize you have been triggered by the past, the fastest and most effective way to bring yourself back into the present is to ground yourself. The grounding practice exercise on <a href="Chapter10.html#page_177">page 177</a> can <a id="page_183"/>help bring you back to the present when you have been triggered by something that reminds you of past trauma.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>OBSTACLES TO SELF-CARE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even after you get in touch with what you need, you may find you still have trouble giving it to yourself. Perhaps you feel that you don’t deserve to take care of yourself, that it is selfish or even unacceptable, depending on your childhood history. If your basic needs were not met, you may have a difficult time knowing how to meet those needs now. You may have a disconnect between being aware of what you need and determining how to provide it for yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">A child needs to receive love in order to be able to feel love; this includes love for oneself. If we do not love ourselves, we will not be motivated to take care of ourselves. Those who were neglected or emotionally abused often look at those who are motivated to take care of themselves with wonder, poignantly aware that there is something missing in them, something that would otherwise allow them to say no to a second piece of cake, or get out of bed at six o’clock in order to get to the gym before work, or leave an abusive partner. That something that is missing is self-love.</p>
<p class="indent">Others care for their bodies but do not care for their emotions or their souls, sometimes devoting so much time to worrying about how they look on the outside that they lose track of who they are on the inside. They can spend hours working out at the gym but not even five minutes checking in with how they feel.</p>
<p class="indent">Some adults who were neglected or emotionally abused do not take care of themselves because they do not feel they deserve it. Children tend to blame the neglect and abuse they experience on themselves, in essence saying to themselves, “My mother is treating me <a id="page_184"/>like this because I’ve been bad” or “I am being neglected because I am unlovable.” Adult survivors often continue this kind of rationalization, and find themselves putting up with poor treatment by friends, bosses, and romantic partners because they believe they brought it on themselves. They feel so unworthy that they actually feel uncomfortable when good things happen to them—and with the idea of providing good things for themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Many survivors of neglect and emotional abuse treat themselves exactly the way their parents did. They are so used to being deprived, abandoned, controlled, shamed, or ignored that they end up depriving, abandoning, controlling, shaming, or ignoring themselves in many of the same ways. But if this describes you, you do not have to stay trapped in the patterns you learned from your parents.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people believe that if they indulge themselves now—by, for example, overeating or overspending—they can make up for the neglect and deprivation they experienced as a child. But although it’s tempting to indulge yourself in order to make up for what you did not receive as a child, this will not change the deprivation you experienced. The only thing that will begin to make up for what you did not receive as a child is for you to become the responsive, nurturing parent to yourself that you deserved all along.</p>

<p class="numb">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Write down examples of how your parents neglected to take care of your basic needs. Focus especially on how they deprived you of comfort, protection, or nurturing.</p>
<p class="numbi"><span class="hide">           </span>One client of Beverly’s wrote: “My parents were always impatient with me, hurrying me around, yelling at me to hurry up. I always felt that I was in the way or that I was irritating them when I tried to tell them about my day at school.”</p>

<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><b>Beverly:</b> <i>My mother neglected me in many ways, including not caring for my physical needs by failing to provide me clean clothes, teach me proper hygiene, or take me to the dentist. Because of this, I spent my early twenties learning how to care for my physical body and having dental work done. She also deprived <a id="page_186"/>me of physical affection, and this (and my sexual abuse) set me up to become sexually promiscuous. Since this was fraught with problems for me, I learned many years later that getting massages was a better way to make up for this physical deficit, and I have made a practice of getting regular massages ever since.</i></p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>WEANING YOURSELF OF YOUR CODEPENDENT BEHAVIOR</b></h3>
<p class="noindent-bs1">When you begin to let go of your singular focus on your partner to also focus on yourself, it is natural to try to fill that emptiness in other ways, such as busying yourself with tasks or obsessing or fantasizing about other people. But that is just substituting one unhealthy behavior for another. The best way to wean yourself of codependent behavior and to address any feelings of emptiness that may arise is to address the problem head-on. The following exercise will help you do this.</p>
<div class="boxg">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">TAKING A DAY OFF</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Try this experiment: Take a “day off” from focusing on your partner, his substance issues, his recovery, or his general needs.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="numbj">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Tell your partner (and your children, if you have them) that you are taking the day off and that they will have to fend for themselves. This means that you don’t want to hear any requests or complaints from them. In fact, if at all possible, ask them to provide you with complete solitude if you stay at home. If you go to a spa or a park or other restful environment, instruct them not to contact you in any way (including text messages) unless it is an emergency.</p>
<p class="numbj">2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Notice throughout the day how often you think about your partner (and your children). Each time, bring your <a id="page_187"/>attention back to yourself—how <i>you</i> are feeling, what <i>your</i> needs are, and so on.</p>
<p class="numbj">3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Pay attention to how you feel when you attempt to think only about yourself. Do you feel selfish? If so, try to assure yourself that you have a right to focus on your own needs and desires.</p>
<p class="numbj">4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Notice if you begin obsessing or ruminating or if you suddenly feel overwhelmed by worry, anxiety, or negative thoughts. If so, take some deep breaths and try to bring your mind to a quiet place.</p>
<p class="numbj">5.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Notice if you begin to feel boredom, apathy, loneliness, or anxiety. If this happens, ask yourself: “What am I <i>really</i> feeling right now?” As we’ve discussed, it is easiest if you focus on the four primary emotions of anger, sadness, fear, and guilt/shame.</p>

<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Here’s what Beverly’s client Rebecca reported about her “day off” to a spa:</b></p>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>I noticed that I felt worthless when I wasn’t doing some task. I know that I keep myself busy at home so I won’t feel my fear and anxiety about my husband’s drinking problem. I wanted to just relax and lie by the pool, but my mind kept focusing on my husband. I wondered if he was using this time away from me to drink. I worked really hard to stop those thoughts, and for a while I was successful. But then I was overwhelmed with the feelings of emptiness and sadness.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you feel overwhelmed with feelings of sadness or emptiness when you focus on self-care or when you try not to worry about your partner, it may be because you are disconnected from your real self—and, as we explained earlier, the best way to reconnect with yourself is by focusing on your emotions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_188"/>Without an external focus (your partner or children, your need to be productive, your worry about your partner using), you may also find that you feel worthless, depressed, and discontented, or are suddenly overwhelmed with negative thoughts. These negative thoughts are often driven by shame.</p>
<p class="indent">As we’ve shown, the best antidote to shame is self-compassion, which neutralizes shame’s persistent poison. By practicing self-compassion you will find that you can begin to heal the shame you may have been carrying around since childhood.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also help address your feelings of depression by learning how to provide yourself with self-kindness.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>PROVIDING YOURSELF WITH SELF-KINDNESS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Self-kindness means giving yourself the gifts of <i>patience, acceptance,</i> and <i>caring</i>. But it also means being tolerant of your flaws and inadequacies, instead of self-critical. And it involves learning simple tools for comforting yourself and supporting yourself whenever you suffer, fail, or feel inadequate.</p>
<p class="indent">Kristin Neff, the leading authority on self-compassion and the author of <i>Self-Compassion</i>, explains self-kindness as responding to ourselves just as we would to a dear friend in need—as allowing ourselves to be emotionally moved by our own pain and suffering and then asking, “How can I care for and comfort myself in this moment?”<a id="rfn35"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Being kind to oneself comes naturally to those who believe they deserve it. But if you’ve experienced a lifetime of shame, neglect, mistreatment, and/or abuse, it can make it hard for you to accept kindness from others, and even harder to believe you deserve self-kindness—much less actually begin practicing it. But if you are willing to apply <a id="page_189"/>the suggested strategies and complete the exercises in this section, you <i>will</i> be able to experience the healing that comes with self-kindness.</p>
<p class="indent">Self-kindness will be especially beneficial as you continue to act as your partner’s supporter or collaborator and as you go through the ups and downs of both his and your own recovery. The kinder and more compassionate we are with ourselves, the more we can develop the courage to tolerate difficult things.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>COMPASSIONATE SELF-TALK</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you find yourself in a distressing situation, talk to yourself in a calm, nurturing way. You can do this silently, inside your head, or, if you are alone, you can talk out loud. Think of the kindest words you could tell yourself—the words you most need to hear.</p>
<p class="indent">Compassionate self-talk does not require you to come up with solutions, nor does it mean making overly optimistic promises to yourself. It is simply <i>an acknowledgment of your pain and suffering.</i> It is a statement of <i>comfort and validation—</i>an avowal that your feelings are important and that you have a right to have them.</p>
<div class="boxs">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Here are examples of compassionate self-talk used by some of Beverly’s clients:</b></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I know how hard this is for you. It hurts to see someone you love being so self-destructive.”</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I’m so sorry you are hurting. You don’t deserve to be hurting like this.”</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I know how tired and stressed you are. You’ve been working so hard! It won’t be long now until you are finished and you can rest.”</p>

<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_190"/><b>FINDING A SELF-CARE STRATEGY THAT WORKS FOR YOU</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whether you already practice some form of self-care or are just beginning to understand its importance, it is essential for your success at helping your partner that you discover what form or forms of self-care are best for you.</p>
<p class="indent">Siri Hoogen, a therapist in Portland, Oregon, and an expert contributor to <a href="http://GoodTherapy.org">GoodTherapy.org</a>, has found that most people need “fuel” from three main sources: physical activities, cognitive activities, and emotional/relational activities.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Physical activities</i> use the body, whether you’re doing something active, such as walking or running; doing something soothing, like massage or self-touch; or even doing something passive, such as sleep.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Cognitive activities</i> use the mind, such as reading, playing games, or taking a class. (Smart phones today offer a multitude of brain-challenging games and activities that may encourage your mind to stretch and exercise in ways it doesn’t with everyday activities.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Emotional/relational activities</i> include experiencing emotion (both good and bad) and engaging in social connection. Emotional refueling can mean enjoying a pleasurable emotion, such as by watching a funny TV show or reading a heartwarming book, or it may mean allowing yourself to cry. (If you know you need to cry but find it difficult to allow yourself to do so, Beverly suggests watching a movie that you know will elicit tears.) Releasing anger in a healthy way, such as “telling off” your partner when no one is around or writing an “anger letter” that you do not give to your partner, <a id="page_191"/>can also be useful. Relational refueling might involve sharing with a close friend or a therapist.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Although you may gravitate toward one or two of these at any given time, we all benefit from making certain that we replenish ourselves from time to time with “fuel” from each of these three main sources.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>FIVE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED METHODS OF SELF-CARE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">You are probably aware of many of the most popular self-care methods—for example, yoga, stretching, and deep breathing. Because these types of self-care strategies are so popular and information about them is so readily available, we won’t go into them here. Instead, we are going to offer you some strategies that you might not be as familiar with.</p>
<p class="indent">The following methods have been found to be particularly beneficial for caregivers and partners of those who are substance dependent, based on research and feedback from Beverly’s clients. Some are especially recommended for stress reduction, while others are geared more toward providing comfort and self-soothing.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Journaling</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Journaling allows you to clarify your thoughts and feelings, thereby gaining valuable self-knowledge. It is also a good problem-solving tool; many of us can hash out a problem and come up with solutions more easily on paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Journaling can counteract many of the effects of stress. Writing about traumatic events helps us process them by fully exploring <a id="page_192"/>and releasing the emotions involved, which allows the experience to become more fully integrated in our mind.</p>
<p class="indent">Journaling as a stress-management and self-exploration tool is not the same as simply recording the events in your life in a diary. For the most helpful results, you should write in detail about your feelings and thoughts related to stressful events (such as your partner’s last relapse) almost as you would discuss issues in therapy.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Music</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">The soothing power of music is well established. It has a unique link to our emotions and a relaxing effect on our minds and bodies. This is especially true of slow, classical music, which can have beneficial effects on physiological functions, including slowing the pulse and heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing levels of stress hormones.</p>
<p class="indent">Music can act as a distraction from our worries, or it can help connect us with our emotions. Listening to calming music before bedtime promotes peace and relaxation and can help induce sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">And it isn’t just listening to music that is beneficial—singing along with music can also be a great release of tension, as can music making.<a id="rfn36"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Nature</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Immersing ourselves in nature has both long- and short-term mental and physical benefits. Numerous studies have shown that access to trees and green spaces calms us and helps alleviate stress. By allowing our minds a respite from the typical sensory overload of a modern environment, time spent in nature tends to be restorative.</p>
<p class="indent">The Japanese have coined a word for a particular type of experience in nature—<i>Shinrin-yoku</i>—which means “taking in the forest <a id="page_193"/>atmosphere” or “forest bathing.” In twenty-four field experiments across Japan, researchers found that forest environments promoted lower concentration of cortisol (the “stress hormone”), lower pulse rate, lower blood pressure, greater parasympathetic nerve activity, and lower sympathetic nerve activity in their subjects than city environments.<a id="rfn37"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">While spending time in the forest may be particularly relaxing and healing, walking or sitting in any green space can offer many of the same advantages.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Massage</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Massage is recommended for several reasons, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It stimulates oxytocin, which research has shown to increase feelings of calm and safety, reduce fear and anxiety, and counteract the increased blood pressure and cortisol associated with stress.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It can help provide comfort and soothing to counteract stress.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It is grounding—that is, massage helps you get out of your head and into your body. Those with codependent tendencies often spend most of their time in their heads—thinking, analyzing, worrying. Getting out of your head and into your body will help you get in touch with your feelings and help create more balance in your life.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It can provide an experience of safe touch for those who were physically or sexually violated, as either a child or an adult.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It can help provide the nurturing and sensuality you may be missing in your relationship.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_194"/><b>Laughter and Humor</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Laughter is a healthy outlet for built-up emotions and a powerful antidote to stress, pain, and conflict. Humor relaxes us, inspires hope, connects us to others, and can keep us grounded, focused, and alert. It provides us with perspective, allowing us to see a situation in a less threatening light. And it also creates psychological distance, which can help us avoid feeling overwhelmed. As Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist, author, and concentration camp survivor, stated in his book <i>Man’s Search for Meaning</i>: “I would never have made it if I could not have laughed. Laughing lifted me momentarily out of this horrible situation, just enough to make it livable . . . survivable.”</p>
<p class="indent">You are in a situation in which you have little or no control, as it’s ultimately up to your partner whether he stops depending upon his substance or activity of choice. There will probably be many dark days that give you little hope for change. Humor and laughter can lighten your burden, at least for a time, so give yourself the gift of watching a funny movie or visiting a comedy club.</p>
<p class="indent">There are physical, cognitive, emotional, and social benefits to humor and laughter:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Increased endorphins and dopamine production, increased relaxation response, and reduced pain and stress (physical)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Increased ability to cope with stress, improved problem-solving ability, and increased creativity (cognitive)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Elevated mood and feelings of well-being; reduced depression, anxiety, and tension; increased self-esteem and resilience; increased hope, optimism, energy, and vigor (emotional)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Bonding with family and friends, increased friendliness and altruism, happier marriages and other close relationships (social)<a id="rfn38"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="imaget"><img alt="" height="2" src="images/line.jpg" width="113"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Choose the self-care technique that attracts you the most and start practicing it. If you find that particular technique easy and fun, keep using it! If, on the other hand, you find it difficult or stressful, or just not useful, go on to try another one. There is no need to stress yourself out about it—that defeats the purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find a particular strategy helpful, you may want to suggest it to your partner as well. It may end up helping him in his recovery. And some couples have found that practicing a self-care technique together actually improves their relationship, since it adds to the things they have in common.</p>
<p class="indent">Finding a way to share laughter with your partner, for example, can be extremely beneficial to the relationship. Humor and playful communication strengthen relationships by triggering positive feelings and fostering emotional connection, such as when we share an “inside joke.” When we laugh with one another, a positive bond is created, which can act as a buffer against stress, disagreements, and disappointments. Shared laughter is also one of the most effective tools for keeping relationships fresh and exciting. And humor is a powerful and effective way to heal resentments, disagreements, and hurts.</p>
