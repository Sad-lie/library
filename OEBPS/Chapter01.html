<p class="centers"><i>“In real love you want the other person’s good.</i></p>
<p class="centers"><i>In romantic love you want the other person.”</i></p>
<p class="centersa">—M<small>ARGARET</small> A<small>NDERSON</small></p>
<p class="noindent3"><b><small>IT CAN BE HARD TO LOVE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN ADDICTION</small>.</b> How do you love someone who lies to you, constantly disappoints you, and seems to value alcohol, drugs, work, or another addiction over you?</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also difficult to love someone who seems like two different people—kind and loving when he isn’t using, angry and defensive when he is. Someone who blames his addiction and everything else that goes wrong in his life on you—and refuses to face the truth about himself and his addiction.</p>
<p class="indent">But if you are reading this book, it probably means that you do still love your partner. That despite hurt after hurt, disappointment after disappointment, and betrayal after betrayal, and despite days where it just doesn’t feel worthwhile to keep up the fight, you haven’t quite reached the point where you want to give up. You are still looking for a way to help your partner. If this is your situation, this book is for you.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_12"/>More than anything else, this book is about compassion. It is about gaining empathy for and understanding of a partner who is dependent on a substance (alcohol, drugs, food) or an activity (gambling, shopping, sex, work). It is about avoiding falling into the trap of codependency—or, if you already have fallen, learning how to replace that codependency with compassion. And it is about allowing yourself to have compassion for yourself in a way that leads to healing in your own life and opens the door for healthier relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">But this book is also, most importantly, about love—how your love for your partner, and his love for you, can contribute to his recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe you’ve heard that those who suffer from an addiction are selfish, egotistical, and narcissistic, and don’t really have the capacity to love anyone else. Maybe you’ve heard that an addict’s primary relationship is with his mind-altering chemical or his compulsive behavior at the expense of other relationships—that the only thing he <i>really</i> loves is his booze or his drugs or his sex or his gambling.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ve probably also heard that partners of those who are substance dependent are by definition codependent, meaning that they are also addicted—but to love. And you may have been told that your behavior is characterized more by neediness, control, manipulation, and resentment than by true love, and that the best thing you can do for your partner and yourself is to walk away.</p>
<p class="indent">While there are certainly some truths to the stereotypes about substance-dependent people and their partners, they are far from absolute. Many who suffer from an addiction truly love their partners and their children, want the best for them, and feel deep shame and regret for their actions and inactions when their addiction takes over. It is as if there is a giant wall between who they are and who they want to be, and they just can’t figure out how to get over that wall. For these people, the capacity to love is there; their addiction just prevents them from expressing it. As one of Beverly’s clients who <a id="page_13"/>was actively in recovery from an addiction to cocaine told her, “I did love people when I was actively using. But I loved to get high more.”</p>
<p class="indent">Far from being unable to love, those who are substance or activity dependent can be extremely sensitive people who are capable of loving very deeply. In fact, they are often so sensitive that they use alcohol, drugs, food, sex, gambling, or work to protect themselves from opening up, becoming too vulnerable, and getting hurt. They are often so broken by past trauma that they are afraid to admit to themselves or others how deeply they <i>do</i> love.</p>
<p class="indent">Those considered codependent can also be extremely sensitive, loving human beings whose issues prevent them from having a healthy relationship with their partner. In fact, as we’ll see, many substance-dependent and codependent individuals encounter similar obstacles when it comes to the ability to love—and can have similar reasons, often rooted in past trauma, for those obstacles.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, many addicts and codependents are drawn to each other for this very reason: They recognize a kindred soul.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>OBSTACLES TO BEING ABLE TO LOVE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">The most powerful obstacle in the way of addicts’ and codependents’ ability to love is that both find it difficult to love themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">This lack of self-love—commonly referred to as low self-esteem—is often the result of not having been adequately loved by their parents or primary caretakers during childhood. If a mother does not emotionally bond with her child, or if she emotionally neglects her child (by offering little to no affection, nurturing, or encouragement), the child feels this lack of emotional connection and experiences it as a deep loss.</p>
<p class="indent">If that same child experiences love from even one other person—a father, a grandmother, a sibling, a family friend, a teacher—it can make a difference not only in the child’s ability to love someone else, but also in his or her mental health. A child who <a id="page_14"/>is not loved, nurtured, and accepted by either or both parents can carry feelings of inadequacy, shame, and even self-hatred into adulthood. While such people may be able to love others, they often still find it difficult or even impossible to love themselves—and this will inevitably affect their relationships.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Filling Up the Emptiness</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some people suffered such extreme neglect or abandonment in childhood that they feel empty inside, and experience such an intense craving for love that no one person can fill them up. This craving for love is often what brings together those who are addicted to a substance or an activity and their codependent partners: Each is looking to the other to give them the love they didn’t receive as children. This same craving manifests in both a codependent’s need to never be alone and an addicted person’s use of their addiction. The codependent is looking for the other person to fill that emptiness, while the addict is looking to a substance or activity to do the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who suffer from feelings of emptiness can also become addicted to the feeling of falling in love, often referred to as a “love addiction.” Rather than develop real relationships of depth and meaning, these people are always searching for the euphoric feeling that comes with the honeymoon phase of every new relationship, a feeling characterized by <i>intensity</i> rather than <i>intimacy</i>. True intimacy takes time and happens through the development of a healthy relationship; constantly seeking intensity more often leads to emotional chaos and does not fulfill the person’s need to be loved.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>An Inability to Connect with Others</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Not adequately bonding with a caregiver by the age of two or experiencing neglect as an infant or young child doesn’t just become an obstacle to loving yourself. It also has an effect on the right frontal <a id="page_15"/>lobe of your brain—the area that determines how you connect with other people. This early “relational trauma” may last a lifetime, making it difficult to connect with anyone without enormous pain and dysfunction. Relational trauma can set a person up for codependency, addiction, and destructive relational patterns, as well as self-esteem issues.</p>
<p class="indent">The research of pioneering clinical scientist Dr. Allan Schore of the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA’s Geffen School of Medicine has shown that in response to a caregiver’s neglect, an infant develops one of two response patterns: hyperarousal (from experiencing high levels of anxiety) or dissociation (from feelings of disconnect from self or surroundings). Either of these relational trauma patterns can be associated with an inability to self-regulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, which results in a compulsion for self-medicating later in life.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. van der Kolk also did research concerning how attachment failures can create difficulties in developing healthy relationships. He refers to this as Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD) and lists its symptoms as relational and chronic: inability to concentrate and regulate emotions; anger, fear, and anxiety; self-loathing; aggression; and self-destructive behavior.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Fear of Intimacy</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Even if a person is capable of loving a partner, it does not mean they will do so. Many substance-dependent people, as well as many codependents, are afraid of intimacy. While each may long for love, they may—ironically—be unable to return it. They are so afraid of being rejected or abandoned the way they were as a child that they can’t risk opening their heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Focusing attention on a substance or activity is one effective way of avoiding intimacy, as is continually becoming involved with “unavailable” partners (partners who are married, those addicted to <a id="page_16"/>alcohol or drugs, workaholics). Constantly focusing on the reasons why one’s partner can’t be trusted is yet another.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>The Walls That Shame Built</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Shame is another major deterrent to being able to love—both oneself and someone else.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who were abused in childhood in particular often suffer from a great deal of shame. Shame is a natural reaction to abuse, as abuse—and the accompanying feelings of violation and helplessness—is by nature humiliating and dehumanizing.</p>
<p class="indent">This isn’t true just for physical and sexual attacks. Constant criticism, name-calling, belittling, unreasonable expectations, and other forms of emotional abuse can be just as harmful and just as shame inducing. Neglect can also create shame in a child, causing him or her to think: <i>If even my own mother doesn’t love me enough to take care of me</i>, <i>I must be worthless</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Some have suffered so much shame that they cannot let in anything good—including love. They push away anyone who loves them, and they sabotage good relationships. Some people experience so much shame in childhood that they build up a defensive wall to prevent ever feeling shamed again. But as long as that wall is up, they can’t really love.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF LOVE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When addicts and codependents can overcome these obstacles and truly love another person, however, that love can transform their lives.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, when a couple falls deeply in love, their love is so strong that it seems to make anything possible—even surviving a substance dependency. In fact, sometimes the love a substance-dependent person has for another person can be so strong that it transforms his life.</p>
<div class="boxs">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="noindents-bs1"><a id="page_17"/><b>Here’s what Beverly’s client Larry has to say about being transformed by love:</b></p>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>When I met Rhonda I was a full-blown alcoholic. I couldn’t get through the day without getting drunk. I met Rhonda at a party where we were both drinking, so she didn’t notice that I had a problem. We had one of those intense nights where we both fell in love and couldn’t keep our hands off each other. I spent the night at her house that very first night and we were a couple from that day forward.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>But about two months into our relationship Rhonda sat me down and said that she wasn’t going to be able to stay with me if I continued drinking at my present pace. She said that she loved to party with me once in a while but that I seemed to need to get drunk every day and she just couldn’t tolerate that. She said that she’d be patient while I worked on myself and did whatever I needed to do to cut back on the drinking but that she wouldn’t stay with me indefinitely.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>I was devastated at the idea of losing her. I’d never loved anyone so deeply and completely before. And no one had loved me as much. No one had been as kind and generous and loving with me. So, I sat myself down and gave myself a good talking-to. I told myself that it was up to me: I could either lose the best thing in my life or I could stop drinking. Believe it or not, I chose to stop drinking—cold turkey, right there and then. I haven’t had a drop since.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">While stories of such dramatic turnarounds aren’t the norm, they also aren’t unheard of.</p>
<p class="indent">Love can also motivate smaller, but still important, changes, such as keeping a dependency from taking over one’s life in order to support one’s family. Beverly’s mother, a single parent, loved her enough to limit her alcohol use to evenings and her days off so she could go to work and support the family. In other words, she loved Beverly enough to become what is often called a “functioning alcoholic.” She often shared with Beverly that before she became a mother she was <a id="page_18"/>an extremely selfish person and that having Beverly taught her how to love.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes love can be so powerful that it can even help heal the wounds of childhood. This can be a powerful experience.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Beverly:</b> When I was in my mid-thirties I met a man who had a similar background to mine. He too suffered from neglect and criticism from his mother and, in addition, she also physically abandoned him when he was six years old, leaving him with a family friend. As is common for couples who are falling in love, we shared our stories with each other. Discovering that there was someone else in the world who had experienced the same pain and feelings of worthlessness felt like a gift to both of us.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>We were together for eight years, and during that time we both experienced a great deal of healing. We would watch movies on TV together and at the end, we would often cry in each other’s arms. For the first time in our lives we had someone to comfort us.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>Although the relationship eventually ended, it did so because we had become too dependent on each other and each of us needed to be alone in order to “find ourselves.” We remain extremely close friends, even after all these years, and the reason is we really love each other. We are both extremely grateful that we had someone in our lives who truly loved us and accepted us the way we were during that crucial time of healing. Our relationship has been the catalyst for powerful healing in both our lives.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">We believe that no one is beyond redemption. Love, understanding, and compassion can heal even the most damaged souls. The love you have for your partner can help him bring down his walls, open up, and take the risk of loving you back. And his love for you can do <a id="page_19"/>the same. But it is not the entire answer. You will learn as you continue reading this book that you each need to learn to overcome any obstacles to loving yourselves as well.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>HOW DO I KNOW IF HE REALLY LOVES ME?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Maybe you’re asking yourself: <i>How do I know if he loves me? He says he does, but he lies so much—how do I know if he’s just lying to me to get me to stay?</i></p>
<p class="indent">It’s true that there are some addicts who perpetually lie, including telling a woman they love her when they are actually just manipulating her.</p>
<p class="indent">Some in the recovery movement believe that it is essential for your partner’s behavior to match his words, and that otherwise you are allowing yourself to be manipulated, controlled, and deceived. No doubt you’ve heard the expression “talk is cheap.” But if you are at a place where you no longer believe the words “I love you,” what behaviors are proof of your partner’s love?</p>
<p class="indent">Some of you may answer, “If he truly loved me he would go into treatment,” and there are some addicts who do finally decide to begin a twelve-step or other program in order to show their partner they love them. But, generally speaking, deciding <i>not</i> to enter treatment is not an indication that your partner doesn’t love you. He may love you but simply not be ready to take this step. (Later, we’ll be discussing ways that you can encourage your partner to seek help without giving him an ultimatum or insisting that doing so is the only way to prove his love to you.)</p>
<p class="indent">So, how does a person act when he really loves you? There is no one answer to this question—especially when it comes to someone with a dependency. Your partner may treat you with respect, kindness, and consideration (all standard indications of love) most of the <a id="page_20"/>time—that is, unless he is using. Then he may turn into a completely different person, saying cruel things, disregarding your feelings, or disrespecting you in front of others. Does this mean that he doesn’t really love you, or does it mean that he is projecting his own self-hatred onto you? Does it mean that he isn’t being genuine when he treats you with respect, kindness, and consideration the rest of the time? There are no easy answers here.</p>
<p class="indent">When someone is overtaken by a strong compulsion to drink or take drugs, to gamble or to seek an illicit sexual release, his concern for others—even others he loves—gets lost. It’s not necessarily the case that he doesn’t love you and care about your needs or your happiness—it’s just that he hasn’t found a way to deal with his compulsion. It likely has nothing to do with his love for you.</p>
<p class="indent">Beverly once asked a very wise therapist, “How do you know if you can trust someone?” Her answer? “The real question isn’t whether or not you can <i>trust the other person</i>. It’s whether you can <i>trust yourself</i> to take care of yourself with this person.”</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Beverly</b>: From that time on, this was the question I asked myself whenever I was uncertain about a relationship: “Can I trust myself with this person? Can I trust myself to take care of myself with this person?” Sometimes the answer was a clear no, and I realized that I had stopped standing up for myself in the relationship or was allowing myself to be manipulated. Either way, I realized I wasn’t safe with that person. Instead of worrying about whether he was trustworthy, I focused my efforts on taking better care of myself with him, creating some distance from him, and, in some cases, getting the courage to end the relationship.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">We encourage you to make the same change in your own thinking. Instead of worrying about whether or not your partner really <a id="page_21"/>loves you or—in cases where his behavior changes radically—trying to figure out which version of him is the “real” one, ask yourself: <i>Can I trust myself to take care of myself with my partner?</i> (Your answer can really determine your next steps; we’ll talk about this shortly.)</p>
<p class="indent">The same wise therapist corrected Beverly one day when Beverly said her mother didn’t love her. “Your mother did love you,” the therapist said. “She just didn’t love you <i>enough.</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">Ask yourself if the same may be true of your partner. Does he, in fact, love you—just not enough to give you the things you need and deserve in a partner?</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>LETTING LOVE BE YOUR MOTIVATOR</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Whether or not you and your partner truly love each other makes a difference when it comes to overcoming a substance dependence and healing your relationship. The reason is this: You and your partner must work together, in collaboration, for your partner to have the best chance for recovery, and for the two of you to have a strong emotional connection. Call it love or loyalty or compassion—it is what makes that collaboration possible. Otherwise it will be too easy to discontinue your efforts when things get tough (and they will). Especially if both of you are lacking in self-love, you may need to rely on the love you have for your partner to pull you through the hard times. Love will help motivate each of you to change, even when your own self-motivation weakens.</p>
<p class="indent">This is no doubt contrary to what you have heard before. Most therapists and recovery experts will say that you have to be able to love yourself before you can help your partner—and in the long run, this is true. But <i>in the meantime</i>, while you are learning to love yourself and working on repairing the damage from your childhood (or other losses), you may need to rely on the love you have <a id="page_22"/>for your partner to help you stay motivated to change and to help him change.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ve also likely heard that those who suffer from substance dependence need to change for themselves, not for someone else. But when you’re dealing with someone who doesn’t love himself—someone who, in fact, may hate himself—the only motivation he may be able to muster at first is his love for you or his children. So, again, <i>in the meantime</i>, while he is working on gaining some self-love, he may need to rely on that love for you for motivation. The good news is that the more positive changes he makes, the better he will feel about himself, and the more self-love he will develop.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Beverly</b>: A couple of years into my relationship with the man I mentioned earlier, he and I talked about my eating habits and my excess weight. I had struggled with my weight nearly my entire life and had terrible eating habits, eating mostly the starchy, fatty foods I had been raised on. My partner assured me that he loved me the way I was, but he also told me that he was concerned about the health risks of me being overweight. Put simply, he didn’t want to lose me.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>At that time I lacked the internal motivation to restrict my diet or to exercise. Because I had been so deprived of love and even some of the basic necessities (including proper nutrition) as a child, I had a tremendous resistance to being deprived of food. And because I always felt awkward in my body, I hated exercise. But here I was causing my partner, a man I deeply loved, to worry, and it was that knowledge that forced me to take a good hard look at myself and decide to lose some weight—not for me, but for him.</i></p>
<p class="blocki"><span class="hide">                  </span><i>During the time I was with him I had more motivation to eat healthy foods and to exercise than I had had in my entire <a id="page_23"/>life. Although it has been a life-long struggle, taking care of myself became a lot easier because of our relationship.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">People who are truly in love can inspire each other to be better. When we know someone believes in us, we want to be the best we can be. We want to become worthy of their confidence in us. And this impulse can be harnessed to help both your partner and yourself.</p>
