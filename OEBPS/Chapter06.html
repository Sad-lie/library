<p class="centersa">—<small>THE</small> D<small>ALAI</small> L<small>AMA</small></p>
<p class="noindent3"><b><small>NOW THAT WE’VE CHANGED THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ADDICTION</small></b> and codependency, it’s time to talk about what you can do to help your partner move toward recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">Although you have the power to help your partner, it is important to understand that there are certain attitudes and behaviors, especially those associated with codependency, that will not be helpful and may even hinder your partner’s progress. These ways of interacting may cause him to push back or, worse, pretend to comply while holding more tightly to the status quo. There are also certain attitudes and behaviors, those rooted in compassion, that you will need to take on in order to maximize the amount of help and support you can provide.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter discusses these attitudes and behaviors, as well as the sometimes subtle differences between supporting your partner in seeking recovery and getting in his way, taking over, or what is commonly referred to as “enabling” him.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><a id="page_102"/><b>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CODEPENDENT BEHAVIOR AND COMPASSIONATE BEHAVIOR</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">When it comes to helping a partner with substance abuse problems, the line between codependency and compassion can be fuzzy because the intentions of both appear to be the same. But while compassion promotes effective communication and mutual respect, codependency can destroy the foundation of even the healthiest relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">When we are being truly compassionate, our intentions are motivated by <i>love and selflessness</i>. In contrast, the underlying motive of codependency is <i>self-protection</i>. As we discussed in the previous chapter, the person exhibiting codependent behaviors and thinking needs to be needed; she pursues acceptance and safety in an effort to avoid abandonment. In this way, codependent actions—although seemingly charitable—are often closer to selfish than selfless.</p>
<p class="indent">As we saw in <a href="Chapter03.html">chapter 3</a>, thinking and behaving compassionately can make us feel good in a variety of ways, activating pleasure circuits in the brain and the secretion of the “bonding” hormone oxytocin. It slows down our heart rate, makes us more resilient to stress, and boosts our immune system. In contrast, codependent thinking and actions deplete our energy and leave us wanting; they can generate a “hangover” feeling similar to the one many addictions produce and can take a toll on our emotional and physical health.</p>
<p class="indent">While both compassionate and codependent behavior may involve attending to the needs of others, and can at times involve personal sacrifice, a compassionate person continues to care for herself in the process; she never abandons herself or her own needs in order to take care of another. The person acting in codependent ways, on the other hand, discards her own needs, replacing them with the needs of the other person. And when she finds herself emotionally and physically exhausted at the end of the day, she often becomes bitter, resentful, and frustrated.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_103"/>Compassion strengthens the foundation of a relationship. Acts of selflessness contribute to mutual appreciation, effective communication, trust, and other key ingredients of successful relationships. In contrast, codependency deteriorates relationships, causing dependency, jealousy, bitterness, destructive behavior, poor communication, and a host of other problems.</p>
<p class="indent">When you are showing compassion and care toward someone, both people come away from the situation feeling energized, empowered, and encouraged, not frustrated, angry, or depleted.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Compassionate Giving versus Codependent Giving</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Those who suffer from codependent ways of thinking can feel as though they don’t have a choice when it comes to taking care of their partner. They tend to have an exaggerated sense of responsibility, as well as a fear of abandonment if they don’t do what their partner wants or needs. They can also feel imprisoned by a sense that something terrible will happen to their partner if they don’t attend to his needs. A compassionate person, on the other hand, is aware that she has a choice and makes her decision to help at any given time carefully and thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="indent">These are the keys to giving in a compassionate way:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You do so in a deeply <i>selfless</i> way as opposed to a <i>self-based</i> way.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You aren’t hooked on the results. You offer information, resources, prayers, and other forms of help, but then you let go and allow your partner to make his own choices.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You offer a listening ear without trying to fix his problems for him.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You seek to support your partner in his own journey while refraining from creating an unhealthy dependence on you.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_104"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You balance kindness with the willingness to say no when saying yes would hurt either of you.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h40"><b>The Motives Check</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Another way to determine whether you are acting from a place of compassion versus a place of codependency is to do a motives check. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Is helping my partner a way for me to distract myself from my own issues?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Do I want to “rescue” my partner because it makes me feel worthwhile, good, needed, important, or proud?</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Am I helping my partner because my identity depends on my ability to help others?</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you are completely honest with yourself, you may discover that you answered yes to some or all of these questions. If this is the case, it is highly likely that codependency, not compassion, is driving your behavior.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>ENABLING BEHAVIORS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Contrary to popular belief, research has shown that not all partners who stay with substance and activity abusers are what those in the recovery movement call “enablers”—but, unfortunately, many are.</p>
<p class="indent">Enabling behavior includes anything that is intended to “fix” a problem created by your partner’s substance dependence—everything from calling his boss to say he is sick when he is actually hungover, to making excuses to friends and family for his inappropriate behavior (“he’s under a lot of stress”), to buying alcohol in the hope that he’ll drink at home rather than go out and risk a car accident.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_105"/>While your intention may be to help your partner, the result is the opposite: Showing him that you will always be there to fix what goes wrong sends the message that you accept his inappropriate behavior. You may scold, nag, or lecture with your words, but your behavior says, “Don’t worry, I’ll always be here to make it easier for you.”</p>
<p class="indent">Being so “helpful” also accomplishes two other very <i>un</i>helpful things:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You drain yourself to the point that you are running on empty, leaving little energy to do the positive things you could be doing to help your partner.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You make it easier for your partner to continue his substance abuse—as long as you are there to fix things, rescue him, clean up the mess, or smooth things over, your partner does not have to face the consequences that might otherwise drive him to make a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="hide">             </span><i><b>Chris:</b> Often when an addicted person is in the throes of active addiction, we use relationships to give us what we think we need. A place to crash, or someone to buy our drugs, give us sex, make us feel alive—you name it, and an addict has found someone to give it to him. We are really good at getting others to give us what we want. The problem is that what we think we need is usually the last thing you should give us. When we get what we think we need from you, it doesn’t work for very long. So, what does the addicted person do next? Do we think that maybe what we are after is the wrong thing for us? No way—we get rid of the person who gave it to us, or we turn to our substance or activity of choice even further to cope. We do the same thing over and over again, thinking we will get a different result—the very definition of insanity. It’s a vicious cycle that doesn’t end until someone leaves, dies, or gets well in recovery.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_106"/>Let’s look at some enabling behaviors that need to be avoided because they impede your partner’s progress.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Fixing</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Fixing refers to behaviors that rescue your partner from the negative effects of his actions—for example, making sure he gets to work on time because he abused drugs the night before, bringing him a cool washcloth and aspirin in the morning to help nurse his hangover, or cutting back on your own spending in order to pay household bills because your partner has lost so much money gambling. Both science and experience tell us that if a substance abuser is prevented from facing the negative consequences of his actions, his behavior is not going to change; instead, things will likely get progressively worse.</p>
<p class="indent">Fixing behaviors may <i>feel</i> like the loving, humane, or sensible thing to do, but what they really do is prevent your partner from having to fix his mistakes himself. Picking up your partner from the bar because he is so drunk that he forgot where he parked his car seems like something that helps him; after all, you don’t want him wandering around drunk. But it might be better to tell him to take a cab. Sure, the cab might cost him an arm and a leg, but having to pay for it might help him face the consequences of his actions.</p>
<p class="indent">The same is true when you drive all over town trying to find his car or call local towing companies to see if his car was impounded: Better to let him find his car himself the next day, once he has sobered up.</p>
<p class="indent">Each time you fix a situation, it reinforces your partner’s belief that no matter how irresponsible or self-destructive his behavior, there are no consequences. He knows that you always take care of everything, so he doesn’t have to. If you really want to motivate your partner to give up his self-destructive behaviors, you absolutely must allow him to be responsible for his own mistakes—indeed, his own life.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_107"/><b>Protecting</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">There is a subtle but important distinction between <i>fixing</i> and <i>protecting:</i> Fixing behaviors tend to <i>solve</i> problems so that your partner doesn’t have to face the consequences of his actions, while protecting behaviors <i>shield</i> your partner from having to face the truth about himself and his substance dependence. Protecting behaviors can also protect your partner by preventing others from seeing the truth about your partner’s substance or activity dependence.</p>
<p class="indent">While it may seem as if protecting your partner is a loving thing to do, you are in fact preventing him from learning how to protect himself. So, ironically, to truly protect your partner you must first <i>stop</i> protecting him, so that he is motivated to protect himself—ideally, by getting help to stop the behavior that’s endangering him in the first place.</p>

<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">ARE YOU A PROTECTOR?</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Do any of the following scenarios sound familiar?</p>
<p class="numb">1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have made excuses to friends or family members for my partner’s failure to show up at a planned event, or made excuses to our children when he didn’t attend their baseball game, recital, or school open house.</p>
<p class="numb">2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have made excuses for my partner’s inappropriate behavior when he got drunk or stoned at a party or when we were having dinner with friends.</p>
<p class="numb">3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have avoided making plans with friends or family because I was afraid my partner would get drunk or high on drugs and become argumentative or inappropriate in some other way, such as becoming too flirtatious.</p>
<p class="numb">4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have paid off my partner’s gambling debts because I was afraid he would get beaten up by the people he owes.</p>
<p class="numb"><a id="page_108"/>5.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have paid off my partner’s credit card to prevent it from being taken away.</p>
<p class="numb">6.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have paid an overdue bar bill or covered a bad check to prevent the owner from banning my partner from the premises or taking legal action.</p>
<p class="numb">7.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have hidden my partner’s problem from family and friends.</p>
<p class="numb">8.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have consoled my partner when he felt guilt, shame, or remorse.</p>
<p class="numb">9.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>I have downplayed the seriousness of my partner’s problem—either to him or to others.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="imageb"><img alt="" height="2" src="images/line.jpg" width="113"/></p>
<p class="noindent">If you aren’t sure whether you are contributing to your partner’s self-destructive behaviors by fixing or protecting, try asking yourself these questions:</p>
<div class="topb0">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><i>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Do I make excuses to myself and others for my partner’s bad behaviors and judgment?</i> This might include minimizing your partner’s substance or activity dependence by calling it a “passing phase,” or contacting his boss with excuses for why he failed to show up for work.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><i>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Do I remain silent in order to avoid confrontations and arguments?</i> Remaining silent for fear of losing your partner’s love protects him from facing the truth. And avoiding confrontation for fear of being subjected to verbal or physical abuse when you voice an opinion suggests that your partner is abusive, not just someone with a dependency problem. While your intention may be to protect yourself from negative consequences, you are preventing him (and possibly yourself) from facing the truth.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_109"/><i>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Do I take on responsibilities that should rightfully be my partner’s?</i> This might include paying his bills, babysitting his children on his visitation days, visiting his parents in the hospital or a convalescent home, or buying flowers for his secretary.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>BEHAVIORS THAT BLOCK YOUR PARTNER’S RECOVERY</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">While fixing and protecting behaviors do not help your partner because they enable him to continue his self-destructive behaviors, other behaviors actually <i>prevent</i> your partner from recovering. These blocking behaviors include any action or attitude on your part that acts as a deterrent to your partner’s recovery.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Shaming</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Shaming, which we talked about in <a href="Chapter02.html">chapter 2</a>, is a classic example of a blocking behavior. For one thing, shaming can cause your partner to become defensive, which may make him unwilling to cooperate in his own recovery. But in addition, it can actually cause your partner to feel worse about himself, which may lead him to lose his motivation to recover. Similar behaviors likely to cause him to become defensive and feel bad about himself include nagging, criticizing, and throwing past mistakes in his face.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Arguing</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Arguing with your partner is another example of a blocking behavior. Those who are substance dependent have a tendency to blame others for their problems, especially their partners. If you argue with your partner about his using, you essentially give him an excuse to blame <a id="page_110"/>you for his problems. For example, he can accuse you of always having to be right, or of not understanding him, and then blame his drinking on these things. And like shaming and criticizing, arguing provokes defensiveness, which in turn undermines motivation.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are in the habit of arguing, notice what happens to you just before you start—the tight jaw, the crossed arms, the tension in your chest. Similarly, take note of the clues that your partner may be feeling defensive and getting ready to argue—the clenched fists, the pacing across the floor. These can all be cues that you need to take a deep breath, step back, and connect with yourself. Notice the emotions you are feeling—anger or fear or sadness—and remind yourself that you have a right to feel these things. Remind yourself that <i>you</i> are responsible for your feelings, not your partner.</p>
<p class="indent">Another effective strategy to help stop arguments is understanding why they start in the first place. We often argue when we are actually feeling ambivalent about the situation ourselves. When our partner presents an opposing view, we may be arguing against our own ambivalence. Taking a few minutes to connect with yourself could reveal this truth. Backing off can also give your partner a chance to connect with himself and discover what he is really feeling. And it can allow him to confront his own ambivalence, so that he starts to argue with himself instead of defending against what you are saying.</p>
<p class="indent">Another reason people argue is that they don’t feel heard. Even though you may not agree with what your partner is saying, you can always tell him, “I hear you” or “I understand what you are saying” or “I understand how you feel.” These are <i>validating statements</i>, meant to express to your partner that he has a right to his feelings and that you do, in fact, hear him and understand him, even if you don’t agree with him. Being heard and being validated are two of the most important needs that we as humans have. Once your partner feels validated and heard, a great deal of his resistance, anger, and need to argue may fade.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_111"/>People also become defensive and argumentative when they feel they are being forced to take one side of an issue or to defend their position. One way around this is for you to acknowledge that there can be two sides to the argument—that both of you can have valid points and valid reasons for your feelings.</p>
<div class="boxs">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>Beverly’s client Marlene was married to Dan, a compulsive gambler in recovery. His best friend Jim was having a bachelor party at a casino in Atlantic City, and Marlene was horrified at the possibility that her husband would experience a relapse if he went. The two of them had been arguing about the situation for weeks.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>In one of her sessions, Beverly encouraged Marlene to stop arguing with her husband and to instead offer him some understanding and compassion. The next week she reported: “I told him, as compassionately as I could, that I understood that it was important for him to go to Jim’s bachelor party. Then I asked him if he could understand why it scared me to think about him going to Atlantic City since the last time he was there he lost a lot of money gambling.”</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Since Marlene expressed understanding for Dan’s point of view, while at the same time offering her own, he had less of a need to justify to her his reasons for wanting to go.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Beverly also suggested that they approach the situation as a dilemma that the two of them could work on together rather than as an argument in which each of them presented only one side. By doing so, Marlene would be inviting Dan to acknowledge his own ambivalence, which could help him see the potential consequences of attending the bachelor party more fully.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Often people pretend that they have no ambivalence, because they are too busy trying to convince us that they are doing the right thing. They may believe that the benefits of their behavior (in Dan’s case, supporting his friend) outweigh the costs (relapsing). If we label their thinking “denial” or call it foolish or selfish and don’t take what they have to say about the benefits seriously, we’re likely to get stuck defending our side of the argument all by ourselves rather than helping the other person see the full picture.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_112"/><b>Tone of Voice</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">How you communicate with your partner can have a major impact on his openness to your help and support. Indeed, the tone you take when you speak to your partner matters as much as—or in some cases more than—your actual words. If your tone is guilt-producing—if it is self-pitying or whining—your partner is likely to put up a defensive wall in order to avoid feeling shame.</p>
<p class="indent">An abusive tone can be just as damaging as abusive words. A sarcastic or mocking tone can be considered emotionally abusive, and the same holds true if your tone is scolding, demanding, belittling, or demeaning. Your partner is not a child (even if you feel that he acts like one at times) and doesn’t need you to remind him of how “bad” he is. Examples of other emotionally abusive communication behaviors include rolling your eyes, making faces, making sounds depicting disapproval or mocking, and giving your partner the cold shoulder or the silent treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The point here is not that you shouldn’t express your feelings about your partner’s substance use. You need to be able to do so, but in ways—and at times—that are constructive for you and for your partner. For example, it will not be constructive to try to talk to your partner when he is drunk or high. Nor is it a good idea to talk to him when he has a hangover.</p>
<p class="indent">To have any hope of getting through to your partner, you need to talk to him in a kind, supportive, collaborative way. If you can’t manage this at a particular moment, wait to speak to him until you can, or at least try to sound neutral—as if you are simply conveying information (for example, about a new book you have discovered) and have no investment in whether he uses the information. It would be ideal if you can work toward really <i>feeling</i> this way when you communicate information—no judgment, no investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, if you tend to yell at your partner, you need to stop doing so. Yelling does absolutely no good and can even cause harm. It <a id="page_113"/>can undercut your partner’s motivation and, perhaps most important, sabotage your attempts to develop a compassionate way of relating to him. If you yell at your partner because you have become discouraged and at that moment believe he will never change, you are being a disapproving parent or boss, not a supportive partner. You become the villain, and he focuses on how mean and out of control you are instead of on what you are trying to tell him or on how he could do something differently.</p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line: Harsh words will only make your partner feel guilt and shame, which in turn will decrease his motivation to change and even his belief that he can change. It will cause him to build up a defensive wall to keep you out and, in the process, make you the enemy, not a supportive partner.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In order for your partner to begin to believe that you truly want to help him, you may need to work on your attitude as well as your behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">Situations are almost never black and white; it is unlikely as clear-cut as “he is the problem and I am the long-suffering partner.” As we’ve discussed, codependent thinking and behavior can also be an addiction. And many experts believe that substance-dependent people and their partners have “parallel symptoms” or “parallel processes.” The substance-dependent person becomes obsessed with their substance or behavior; their loved one becomes obsessed with their partner.</p>
<p class="indent">Some partners collude with their substance-dependent partner’s denial and rationalization by making excuses for his behavior. Just as the substance abuser’s tolerance for the addictive substance or behavior increases, so can his loved one’s tolerance for her partner’s behavior. And just as the substance-dependent partner isolates himself from the outside world, his partner tends to do the same.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_114"/>So, the first thing you need to do is adjust your attitude. You are not your partner’s savior, you are not morally superior to him, and you are not doing him a favor just by being with him. If you continue to view yourself this way—as a savior, a victim, or a martyr—your attempts to help him are not going to work. He will stay sick and so will you.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not a coincidence that you and your partner are together. You each have something to learn from one another, and you can each help the other learn your lessons. The most important thing you can do to support your partner in his recovery is to show that you are truly supportive and on his side. Begin to treat him with more kindness and respect, and communicate with him in a kinder, more respectful way (we’ll talk more about how to do this in <a href="Chapter08.html">chapter 8</a>). Stop trying to control him, and start giving him the space he needs to make his own mistakes and learn from them.</p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line: Your partner needs your compassion, not your contempt; he needs your support, not your pity; and he needs your acceptance, not your criticism.</p>
