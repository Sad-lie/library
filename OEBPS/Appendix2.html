<p class="noindent">As the partner of someone who is substance or activity dependent, your ultimate goal has likely been to encourage your partner to get into some kind of recovery or treatment program. But as we have discussed, there is no “one size fits all” when it comes to how a person recovers from a dependency.</p>
<p class="indent">While twelve-step programs and inpatient treatment programs are still the gold standard for many experts, others, such as the founders of the CRAFT program, believe that different people need different options and in various combinations when it comes to recovery. These options include the following:</p>

<p class="indent">There are many therapeutic options, some more supported by evidence of their effectiveness than others. But it’s clear that having a choice of treatment plans leads to more positive outcomes. Giving people options helps them become invested in whatever plan they choose.</p>
<p class="indent">Interventions or threats such as “rehab or else” may get your partner into rehab, but coercion may kill his motivation to participate in treatment once he gets there, as well as undermine his motivation to continue making changes afterward. On the other hand, an ultimatum may not get him into rehab at all and instead may only succeed in increasing his defensiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">Rehab may be the best option for your partner—but it also may not be. The important thing is to help your partner find the best kinds of treatment for his or her particular problems.</p>
