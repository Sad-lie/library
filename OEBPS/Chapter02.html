<p class="noindent3"><b><small>BEFORE WE GO ON, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE A MOMENT</small></b> to think about your partner and ask yourself: <i>Is there enough love left in our relationship to help heal it?</i></p>
<p class="indent">Living with a substance-dependent partner can erode your love for him. Disappointment after disappointment, hurt after hurt can pile up until it is difficult to find the love you once shared under the rubble of broken promises, broken dreams, and broken commitments.</p>
<p class="indent">You may be sure that you still love your partner. When he is not using he may seem like his old self—loving, kind, caring, concerned about others. He may still be a good father, a good provider, and even a pillar of the community, volunteering his time to help others, attending church, and making a real difference in other people’s lives.</p>
<p class="indent">But even then, you may be questioning why you are still with him. When he uses or is involved in a compulsive activity, you may witness only the selfish, egotistical, uncaring, even cruel side of him. You may find yourself wondering: <i>Who is the real man?</i></p>
<p class="indent">The bottom line is this: You and you alone must be the one to decide whether you have the motivation, the strength, and the love to continue struggling with your partner one more day.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_26"/>Separating your feelings of love from those of need and obligation can help you make the decision whether to stay or go. It’s important to realize that you don’t <i>need</i> each other. He can survive without you, and vice versa. He doesn’t need you to make him better. You can certainly help him on his journey, and the help you offer can be powerfully effective if you follow the strategies we recommend. But, ultimately, he and he alone will be the one to decide to get better. If you find you have to leave, you won’t damage him to the point that he descends into a hopeless place. (If he is that close to the edge, he needs more help than you can offer, probably from a psychotherapist.) Don’t underestimate his ability to take care of himself. Those who are substance dependent are very resourceful.</p>
<p class="indent">You may be convinced that you need him as well, but this is also far from true. No matter how dependent you have become on your partner—financially, emotionally—you can work toward becoming stronger and more independent.</p>
<p class="indent">The important thing to remember here is that needing each other is not enough of a reason to stay together—in fact, it can add to your relationship problems. The more you feel you need your partner, the more angry you will be when he lets you down, and the more likely you’ll be to start a fight.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>WHEN LOVING HIM IS NOT ENOUGH</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s assume that you do feel confident that you love your partner. You also need to feel confident that he loves you.</p>
<p class="indent">If your partner was sober or clean when you first met but became addicted after, you know the toll his addiction has taken on your relationship. You likely still remember what he was like when he was sober and how clearly he demonstrated his love for you. And there may be times, when he isn’t using, that he still shows you how much <a id="page_27"/>he loves you. The combination can make it worth it for you to stay with him and try to help him in his recovery efforts.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if he has been using for as long as you have known him and he’s always treated you badly, he may be one of those people who are incapable of loving another person, instead using others for companionship, sex, or money.</p>
<p class="indent">There are other clear indications that a partner doesn’t or can’t love you enough to warrant your efforts to save the relationship:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner has told you that he no longer loves you.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner has told you that he no longer finds you attractive and no longer wants to have a sexual or romantic relationship with you.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner has told you that he loves someone else.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner has told you that he is gay.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It may seem obvious that if your partner has told you any of these things, you shouldn’t stay in the relationship. But you may be the kind of person who needs to have things stated very bluntly before you can face the harsh truth. If your partner has told you any of these things, you should not waste your time trying to help him recover—even if <i>you</i> still love <i>him</i>. You might tell yourself that if you love him enough, or if you change enough, he will regain the love he once had for you. You might tell yourself that you love him so much that you are certain your love can heal him, and that it doesn’t matter whether he loves you or not—you have love enough for both of you. You might even tell yourself that you can just be friends and still make the program laid out in this book work—that he is the father of your children or you have a business together or you have known each other for too long for you to just walk away when he needs your help.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are telling yourself any of these things, you are in denial. No matter how much you love him, no matter how many <a id="page_28"/>entanglements you have, you can’t play the role of his collaborator in recovery unless there is real love between you—love that you both share. If he has moved on to another relationship, or he no longer wants to share a romantic or sexual relationship with you, or he has revealed to you that he is gay, the relationship is over and you need to move on. No matter how much you would like to help him, and no matter how much you believe you can help him, he has to want both your help <i>and</i> your love. And he has to be in a position to return that love.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>IF HE HAS BECOME ABUSIVE</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even if you have good reason to believe your partner loves you (or at least as much as he is able), if he has become emotionally, physically, or sexually abusive toward you <i>and</i> he refuses to admit that he is abusive, love is not enough. We cannot stress this enough. If he tells you that he is not being abusive, that you are exaggerating and “making a mountain out of a molehill,” or if he blames you for his abusive behavior (“If you didn’t argue with me so much, I wouldn’t hit you”), you cannot collaborate with him in his recovery from substance dependency.</p>
<p class="indent">The reason? An abusive relationship is not an equal one. Put simply, your partner is attempting to dominate and control you, even though he may not be aware of it consciously. He does not view you as an equal, but as someone who is beneath him, in status, intelligence, financial resources, or some other way. In order to have a collaborative relationship, you each need to see the other as an equal, not someone you can control, not someone who is your subordinate or “less than” you in some way.</p>
<p class="indent">Many who suffer from addiction have “co-occurring” issues, which means that they suffer not only from a substance dependence problem but also from a mental illness such as clinical depression <a id="page_29"/>or bipolar disorder or from a personality disorder such as narcissism or borderline personality disorder. More and more, substance abuse specialists are recognizing that they need to treat both the addiction problem and the mental illness or personality disorder, and many treatment programs now offer dual treatment. If your partner has become abusive toward you, he may need an assessment to determine whether he also has a mental illness or personality disorder.</p>
<p class="indent">Trauma is also highly prevalent in the history of substance abusers, including childhood trauma such as physical and sexual abuse. We will discuss this connection in more detail later on. For now, just know that if your partner has a history of childhood abuse or neglect, these experiences can lead not only to substance dependencies and compulsive behaviors but to intimate partner abuse, either emotional or physical. While it is important for you to have compassion for your partner if he had such childhood experiences, it is equally important that both of you be honest with yourselves about whether he is repeating that cycle of abuse by abusing you.</p>

<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Beverly’s client Robert discusses his abusive behavior toward his wife when drinking:</b></p>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>I hated myself because I was sexually abused as a child. I felt so much shame about it and I blamed myself for “allowing” it to happen. I drank to try to wipe out the shame, but when I got drunk I turned into a monster. All my pent-up shame and anger came out and I said horrible things to my wife—things I really felt about myself. I called her a whore and accused her of sleeping with other men. I pushed her for sex when she clearly wasn’t interested, and I have to confess, sometimes I even forced myself on her sexually.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>When I sobered up I felt horrible about what I had done to her. I had essentially treated her the way my perpetrator had treated me, trying to rid myself of my shame by dumping it on her. Until I became sober I refused to admit I had been abusive to her. I didn’t want to face even more shame, so I <a id="page_30"/>lied to her and to myself about it. I denied I’d been abusive, denied I’d said those terrible things to her, denied I’d forced her into having sex.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>She ended up leaving me, and I don’t blame her. I wasn’t ready to face my demons and I wasn’t ready to admit I had been victimized by a man. I preferred to believe I had let the man have sex with me rather than admit to myself or anyone else that I had been overpowered by him. And as long as I refused to admit I had, in fact, been raped, I was a dangerous person to be around, especially when I was drinking.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">If your partner is able to recognize that he has become abusive and can admit that he needs help in order to stop this behavior, it is possible to establish a collaborative relationship concerning his recovery from substance dependency. It will, however, be necessary for him to agree to go into a treatment program for those with a dual diagnosis and/or to agree to go into individual psychotherapy to work on his abuse issues. <i>Couples therapy is not recommended when one partner is abusive</i>. Not only can it be counterproductive, but often it is also damaging to the person who is being abused.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how much you love your partner and he loves you, both his substance abuse issues <i>and</i> his issues surrounding abuse need to be addressed if there is any hope for a healthy relationship.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>WHEN IS IT TIME TO LEAVE?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even if you love your partner and are confident that your partner loves you, you may still decide that you can no longer live together or continue a romantic relationship. Your partner’s substance dependence may have become so extreme that it is creating negative consequences not only for him, but for you as well, consequences that you simply can no longer endure.</p>

<p class="noindents-bs1"><a id="page_31"/><b>Beverly’s client Sara talks about choosing to leave her husband, whom she loved:</b></p>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>My husband is a wonderful man. He is a loving husband and friend to me and a great father to our son. It breaks my heart to say this, but in spite of how much I love him and he loves me, I have come to the painful conclusion that I must get a divorce from him. He is a compulsive gambler who has nearly bankrupted us.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>I’ve tried everything to get him help so he will stop. But he is a proud man who refuses to admit he has a real problem. He refuses to go to therapy or to a twelve-step program because to him these are for “weak” people. Instead he continues to make excuses, blaming “bad luck” for his losses and continually promising to cut down on his gambling. He says it is how he copes with stress but he doesn’t “need” to do it.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>In order to save our house I’ve been advised by a lawyer that I have to get a legal separation or a divorce. That way we’ll have to divide what money is left and I won’t be responsible for any of his future debts or have my credit damaged.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Even though I hate to put my son through a divorce, he is getting older and soon he’ll begin to understand what his father does when he goes away on weekends. And I’m afraid of the type of people my husband hangs out with. They are some pretty seedy characters. I’m afraid of what could happen to my son and myself if my husband couldn’t pay a gambling debt.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>If I didn’t still love him so much, it wouldn’t be so difficult. How do I walk away from a man who has been so good to me and my son? How do I just give up on him? I know it isn’t his fault, I know some of what he went through as a child, and I know this addiction comes out of those childhood experiences, but I can’t force him to get help.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">Sometimes no matter how much you love each other, the problems your partner’s substance abuse problems have caused are so <a id="page_32"/>destructive that you have to walk away. We’re not talking about walking away as a form of “tough love” in order to motivate him to change. We’re talking about self-preservation. When your partner’s substance dependence threatens your emotional, psychological, or physical well-being, then you may have to walk away—move out, stop all contact—until he has received enough help that he’s no longer a threat to you or your children.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are some examples of situations in which the right decision may be for you to walk away:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner has become dangerous—meaning that he presents a potential threat to the physical and/or emotional well-being of either you or your children. For example, he has become physically abusive toward you or your children, he threatens to kill you or your children, or he threatens to kill himself.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>You clearly can’t take care of yourself with your partner because you allow him to continue to abuse you, betray you, or treat you poorly in other ways.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Your partner’s gambling addiction or drug abuse has put you and your children in danger. For instance, he owes money to criminals who have threatened to harm his family, or he has brought dangerous people into your life.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In these situations the question needs to shift from “Does my partner love me enough?” to “Do I love myself enough?” If you stay in your relationship despite any of the above, what you are really saying is that you do not love yourself enough to take care of yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">If you, too, struggle with addiction, and especially if you’ve been working on yourself for a long time in either a recovery program or therapy, you may need to acknowledge that you and your partner may not be at the same stage of recovery or the same level of self-awareness. This disparity may be more than you can tolerate. <a id="page_33"/>As much as you love your partner and wish him well, you may not feel willing or able to wait for him to get to a place in his recovery where he can work on the relationship—or even be a decent person to be around.</p>
<p class="indent">One more thing to consider: Even if you decide to leave your partner, you won’t be leaving behind the reasons you chose him in the first place. Unless and until you become clear about that, you are very likely to repeat the same scenario with someone else. Freud called this the “repetition compulsion,” a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a traumatic (or highly stressful) event or its circumstances over and over again in the hopes of resolving the trauma. This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. In other words, you repeat the same situation with a different person hoping that, <i>this</i> time, the outcome will be different. Unfortunately, it rarely is. So if you have decided to leave your partner, make sure you still take the time you need to understand why you chose him in the first place; we will discuss possible reasons later on in the book.</p>
<p class="imaget"><img alt="" height="2" src="images/line.jpg" width="113"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Hopefully, the above information will help you decide whether to continue your relationship or end it.</p>
<p class="indent">If you do decide to stay, know that your belief in your partner, yourself, and your relationship can help get you through the hard times. It won’t be easy. It is going to take hard work and impeccable self-honesty on your part. And you’re going to have to learn a lot about self-care, limits, and boundaries.</p>
<p class="indent">But if you choose to go forward, welcome. We will try to help you feel good about your decision all along the way. Remember, you are not doing this just for your partner, you are doing it for yourself as well. Chances are you are going to help yourself as much as you are helping him.</p>
