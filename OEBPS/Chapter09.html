<p class="image"><img alt="" height="2" src="images/linec.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<h2 class="h2c1"><a href="Contents.html#rch9"><b>Becoming a Compassionate Collaborator</b></a></h2>
<p class="noindent3"><b><small>YOU’VE DECIDED THAT YOU ARE IN A GOOD PLACE EMOTIONALLY</small></b> to become your partner’s collaborator (you regularly practice self-care, and your partner’s substance dependence does not get in the way of your own recovery process). You’ve also read the previous chapter on creating a supportive environment. Your partner has admitted that he has a problem and is open to your help.</p>
<p class="indent">The next step is discussing with him the idea of you becoming his collaborator. Make sure that both you and your partner are making a free choice to begin this process—that neither of you is doing it out of obligation. Don’t decide to become his collaborator because you “owe it to him” as his partner. And he doesn’t “owe it to you” to try this because you have put up with so much from him. Be careful that you do not emotionally blackmail him into agreeing by subtly suggesting (or overtly announcing) that this is his last chance and that you will leave him if he doesn’t cooperate, or that doing this is the only way to prove that he loves you.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_148"/>You can ask him to read this book, as well as <i>Beyond Addiction,</i> or simply explain the process of becoming his collaborator. Once he understands what you’re suggesting, ask him how he feels about it.</p>
<p class="indent">If he immediately rejects the idea, ask him in a nondemanding way what turns him off about it. If he is willing and able to explain his reasons to you, listen without making any comments. One of your roles, as collaborator <i>or</i> supporter, is to try to understand his position. Once he is finished, and only if he seems open to it, see if you can explain the concept to him in a way that is less threatening and even inviting. If he still doesn’t like the idea, drop it for now. There may be another time when he seems more open to it and, as detailed in the previous chapter, there are ways you can begin to support him even without his cooperation.</p>
<p class="indent">If he likes the idea of you being his collaborator, ask him how he envisions you playing this role. Asking for his ideas first—as opposed to beginning with your own—is in fact a good example of collaborative behavior on your part. Give him time to think instead of pressuring him for answers. In the meantime, work on becoming more patient (one of the skills of being supportive). By giving him time, you will probably get a fairly good sense as to whether he is enthusiastic about the idea or has concerns. If you sense he is ambivalent, invite him to talk about his concerns and listen openly. Don’t try to persuade him or argue with him.</p>
<p class="indent">If he doesn’t get back to you at all, don’t nag him; instead, ask him if he needs more time to think about it, if he forgot about it, or if he has decided he doesn’t really like the idea. Make sure you do this with a good attitude and without sighing, eye rolling, whining, or self-pity.</p>
<p class="indent">If your partner comes back with some ideas about how he’d like you to collaborate with him on his recovery, acknowledge his willingness by first simply listening without comment. Some of his ideas may strike you as foolish or may sound too “enabling,” but just hear him out. One of your roles as his collaborator is to help him bring <a id="page_149"/>out the best in himself. So, don’t shut him down, no matter what he says. Often, what sounds like a bad idea may become a good one if your partner is allowed to explore it freely. Try to find something in what he shared with you to respond to in a positive light. For example: “I really loved your idea about____. Can you tell me more about why you think it might help you?” While an idea may have sounded ridiculous to you initially, his answer might change your mind, or the two of you might be able to work together to discover a way to tweak his idea into something more workable.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>CREATE A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In order to facilitate the collaboration between you and your partner, we encourage you to create a Collaboration Agreement. This agreement should include the following details:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>How much assistance your partner wants and needs</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>How you will offer that assistance</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>How to determine when that assistance is no longer needed</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In creating this agreement, you and your partner will need to work together, using both of your ideas. You may even find it helpful to actually write out your agreement so there are no disagreements in the future as to what your role is.</p>
<p class="indent">Although you need to allow him to be the leader in the discussion, do not agree to anything you are uncomfortable with. For example, Beverly’s client Roger wanted his wife Jasmine to tell him two positive things about himself every day in order to make up for all the negative things he felt she had said about him in the past. He thought this would help raise his self-esteem. At first Jasmine <a id="page_150"/>thought this sounded like a good idea, but after thinking about it for a while she realized she wasn’t comfortable with it. First of all, it felt to her as if she was being made to “pay” for her previous comments. Second, she felt it wasn’t her role to raise his self-esteem—it was his.</p>
<p class="indent">Jasmine explained these reasons to him, adding that it didn’t feel “organic” to have to come up with two items every day. She felt too much pressure to have to do so on demand. Instead, she promised to tell him more often when she was feeling good about him or about something he had done. This seemed to satisfy Roger.</p>
<div class="boxs">

<p class="noindents-bs1"><b>Here is the text of Roger and Jasmine’s Collaboration Agreement:</b></p>
<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span>We agree to work together to help Roger be successful in his efforts to reach recovery from alcohol abuse.

<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>In order to make the most of our collaborative efforts, Jasmine agrees to do the following:</p>

<h3 class="h3t"><b>HOW DO I KNOW IF I’M BEING COLLABORATIVE?</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">You may not always feel certain that you are being collaborative and helpful in the way you are speaking to your partner, the suggestions you are making, the things you are doing, or even the way you are thinking about a problem. When this happens, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<div class="top">

<p class="blocks"><span class="hide">             </span><a id="page_152"/>In <a href="Chapter06.html">chapter 6</a> we introduced you to Marlene and Dan. Dan wanted to go to his friend’s bachelor party in Atlantic City even though he was a compulsive gambler in recovery; Marlene thought it was too risky for him to go. Here is how Marlene and Dan dealt with the problem in a collaborative way.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Marlene started the conversation with “I understand how important it is that you go to support your friend Jim, and you acknowledge that it will be difficult for you not to gamble while in Atlantic City. So, what ideas can we come up with to help you resist the urge to gamble while you are there?”</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Together, they came up with four ideas:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="blockn1"><span class="hide">                  </span>1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Dan will call Marlene to check in while in Atlantic City.</p>
<p class="blockn1"><span class="hide">                  </span>2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Dan will not drink too much alcohol while there since alcohol impairs his judgment.</p>
<p class="blockn1"><span class="hide">                  </span>3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Dan agrees to limit the amount of money he has access to while in Atlantic City.</p>
<p class="blockn1"><span class="hide">                  </span>4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Marlene will meet Dan in Atlantic City after the bachelor party for a couple’s retreat.</p>
</div>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>This collaborative effort on both their parts turned out to be successful. Dan called Marlene every evening just before he was to meet up with his friends. He had agreed to do this (and wasn’t coerced by Marlene) because he suspected that touching base with her would help him feel connected to her and remind him of the new life they were building together.</p>
<p class="blocksi"><span class="hide">                  </span>Checking in with Marlene also encouraged him to take his “emotional temperature” to discover how he was feeling about himself and the situation. One night during their call, Dan realized that he wasn’t feeling emotionally strong. He was extremely tired and had been drinking too much, and it was catching up with him. While on the phone with Marlene, he decided not to meet his friends that night but to go to bed early instead. He reported waking up the next day feeling refreshed, strong, and confident in his ability to take care of himself. In the past he would have ignored his own needs and feelings and pushed himself to meet his friends so he wouldn’t disappoint them.</p>
<p class="blocksi-bs1"><span class="hide">                  </span><a id="page_153"/>Knowing that Marlene was going to meet him after the bachelor party for a couple’s retreat gave Dan something to look forward to whenever he began to feel deprived because he wasn’t gambling. He spent quite a lot of time planning what they would do when she arrived and making special arrangements to surprise her—a positive alternative to spending his time feeling sorry for himself.</p>

<h3 class="h3t"><b>THREE RECOMMENDED COLLABORATIVE STRATEGIES</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="Chapter03.html">chapter 3</a> we introduced CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training), a scientifically supported, evidence-based, clinically proven approach to helping families cope with and support substance-dependent family members.</p>
<p class="indent">CRAFT’s program has three goals: (1) to teach partners and family members skills to take care of themselves, (2) to teach them skills they can use to help their loved one change, and (3) to reduce substance use, whether their loved one gets formal treatment or not.</p>
<p class="indent">Why does CRAFT work? Here are some of the reasons:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull0"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It is based on the idea that people do not use substances in a vacuum. Relationships impact substance use just as substance use impacts relationships.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It assumes that most family members and friends have good intentions, good instincts, and a healthy (versus codependent) desire to help.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It treats the problems that families face regarding when and how to help their substance-dependent loved one as a deficit of skills—skills that can be learned—rather than as a disease of codependence.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_154"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It uses collaboration and kindness rather than confrontation and conflict.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The following strategies are based on CRAFT’s approach, modified to make them more collaborative. However, whereas CRAFT’s program encourages family members to complete these strategies on their own, even without their loved one’s agreement or participation, we feel strongly that when dealing with a partner, the person should be part of the process from the beginning. Rather than try to dictate a one-size-fits-all plan, we suggest you create your own program using the aspects of each strategy that fit your needs, personality, and lifestyle. If a strategy doesn’t feel like something both you and your partner will be comfortable doing, by all means, do not do it!</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Strategy #1: Perform a Behavioral Analysis</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">As we discussed in <a href="Chapter04.html">chapter 4</a>, a primary way to gain compassion for someone is to understand them better—including why they do what they do. A <i>behavior analysis</i> involves systematically thinking through the specifics of how and why your partner uses a substance or engages in a compulsive behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">This strategy is designed to help you understand your partner on a much deeper level. If done with your partner—which we recommend—it will also help your partner gain a deeper understanding of (and compassion for) himself. Understanding the reasons why your partner engages in dependent or compulsive behavior—his motivation—is also the key to helping him stop, because the problem contains the seeds of its solution. Often when a person discovers another, healthier way to feel better or to cope with not feeling good, he no longer chooses the unhealthy alternative.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that when we refer to your partner’s motivation, we aren’t just talking about deep-rooted issues such as child abuse or abandonment. We’re also referring to day-to-day reasons for using substances <a id="page_155"/>or engaging in related behaviors. For example, your partner may drink in order to feel less depressed and anxious; he may take drugs to block out painful memories; he may gamble in order to feel an adrenaline rush that pushes away sadness. Earlier we discussed human beings’ deep need to bond and form connections with others in order to feel fulfilled. Sometimes when we can’t connect with each other, we connect with anything we can find—even when that connection is not real, as in the case of a man who is unable to maintain an intimate relationship with a woman and attempts to gain the same feeling of connection by calling a phone sex line. The desire for connection could be your partner’s motivation to use.</p>
<p class="indent">A behavior analysis accomplishes six goals:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It gives you an estimate of your partner’s current use (which can, in turn, be used to measure future changes).</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It helps you recognize the predictability in your partner’s substance use. It may feel as if his substance use is random, but there is likely a real pattern to it. Recognizing this pattern can help you stop living in fear of another episode.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>3.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It clarifies your partner’s “triggers” (the reasons for his behavior)—including who or what triggers him and where or why he might be triggered.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>4.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It identifies the negative consequences of his behavior, along with the positive ones, so you can pinpoint options for changing the balance.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>5.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It helps you feel empathy toward your partner, as you begin to understand his use from his perspective.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>6.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>It can be the beginning of a collaborative relationship with your partner. In fact, since you may need to ask him questions in order to complete the analysis, it can be the first step toward working together.<a id="rfn29"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<h3 class="h3a"><a id="page_156"/>{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS OF YOUR PARTNER’S SUBSTANCE USE OR COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Find a time and place for you and your partner to have an undisturbed discussion. The optimal way to do this analysis is for you to verbally ask your partner these questions and then write down his answers, thereby involving both of you in the process while making it clear that your role is to facilitate and observe his process. Give your partner time to think about each response and offer to help him only if he is absolutely stuck and asks for your help. The questions are divided into sections, and you may find that you get through only one section before needing to take a break or even stop for the day.</p>
<p class="indentb">If your partner is uncomfortable doing this exercise with you, it is fine for him to do it alone and then, if he chooses, share the information with you either verbally or in writing.</p>
<p class="indentb">Even if your partner refuses to complete this exercise, or does not want to involve you as a collaborator in his recovery, you may want to try to answer these questions yourself. This option isn’t ideal, but it will still yield important information that can help you with the other strategies we offer in this chapter.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Strategy #2: Reinforce Positive Changes</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Earlier we discussed the various reasons why your loved one may have become dependent on certain substances and/or activities, stressing that substance dependency is usually caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, environment, and physiological and psychological variables.</p>
<p class="indent">But at the core of all these factors is a <i>choice</i>, made consciously or unconsciously, each and every time the person uses. The decision to use mood-altering substances is a choice even when the behavior becomes so automatic that it no longer looks or feels like a choice. These choices are based on the results a person expects from making that choice—what he expects to feel or get. Those results can include pleasant physical sensations and emotions, or the lessening of negative emotions or anxiety—for example, feeling more relaxed after a drink or temporarily escaping from emotional pain through sex.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_158"/>The chain of events whenever your partner uses goes like this: He takes an action. What follows either increases or decreases the likelihood that he will repeat that action in the future. Anything that reinforces the likelihood one way or the other is what behaviorists call a <i>reinforcer</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the authors of <i>Beyond Addiction,</i> “Mood-altering substances (and some behaviors) are powerful reinforcers due to their effect on the brain.”<a id="rfn30"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn30"><sup>30</sup></a> When your partner chooses to use a mood-altering substance, he feels good; that leads him to want to choose it again.</p>
<p class="indent">Reinforcers can also take the form of something negative <i>not</i> happening. For example, perhaps your partner says that when he drinks, he doesn’t think about the past. In this case drinking is reinforced by the absence of painful memories and the feelings that accompany them.</p>
<p class="indent">The good news is that reinforcement works the same way for behaviors that you <i>do</i> want to happen again. For example, let’s say your husband has told you that one of the reasons he stops off at the bar on the way home from work is that he needs some downtime before facing the stress of being around the kids. Arranging for him to have a half hour of quiet time in his home office or den when he first comes home may serve the same function—and, if so, will reinforce the likelihood of him coming home for that downtime instead of going to the bar the next time. In both cases, the reinforcer is the removal of stress. You’re just changing which behavior it’s reinforcing.</p>
<p class="indent">This reinforcement of constructive, non-substance-related behavior is CRAFT’s core strategy. According to CRAFT’s creators, <i>reinforcement is the single most effective tool you have in your attempts to help your partner</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">This is where your choices come in. You can choose to respond to your partner’s positive, non-using behaviors in a way that will increase the likelihood of these behaviors reoccurring. At the same <a id="page_159"/>time, you can choose to respond to his negative behaviors in a way that decreases the likelihood that they will reoccur.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, here are the two most powerful things you can do to help promote change:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>1.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Reward your partner for positive behavior (which we’ll discuss in this section).</p>
<p class="num"><span class="hide">      </span>2.<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Ignore negative behavior, or withdraw a reward (which we’ll discuss in the next section).</p>

<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3m"><b>T<small>HE</small> D<small>IFFERENCE BETWEEN</small> E<small>NABLING AND</small> R<small>EINFORCING</small></b></h3>

<p class="blockp-l">The term “enabling” refers to anything you do that <i>reinforces or increases the likelihood of your partner’s substance-using behavior</i> or any other behavior you don’t want to support. On the other hand, a positive reinforcement strategy <i>reinforces or increases the likelihood of your partner’s positive behaviors</i>.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>Identify Substitute Rewards</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">It is important that you learn how to identify activities that can compete with your partner’s substance use. The next step will be to identify the rewards the two of you will choose to put into place for the behavior you want to encourage.</p>
<p class="indent">You probably know the Serenity Prayer: <i>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference</i>. Identifying rewards has the added benefit of helping you focus on things you <i>can</i> change, by giving you something definite and proactive to do.</p>
<p class="indent">The following are some general guidelines for selecting and applying rewards as reinforcers:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span><a id="page_160"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Choose rewards he will like.</i> Take some time to brainstorm (preferably together) about what he likes and write down as many ideas as you can. For example, he loves foot rubs, or he has a special meal he likes you to cook but it takes a long time to prepare it so you don’t do it very often.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Choose rewards based on kindness rather than materialism.</i> A warm welcoming hug, a sincere thank-you, a smile, or an affectionate touch as you walk by are far superior reinforcers to buying him something he wants. They not only provide reinforcement closer to the time of your partner’s change in behavior but are also likely to bring the two of you closer together and improve your relationship.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>Don’t choose rewards that are uncomfortable for you.</i> If a cuddle or a neck rub wouldn’t feel good to you because you feel so angry with or distant from your partner, choose something a little less intimate. Reinforcement is not about pretending everything is fine. Think of another reward that he would like and you can do comfortably.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>If you have to fake it, you shouldn’t do it.</i> People often resist the rewarding strategy because they believe that they won’t be expressing their “real” feelings—hostility, resentment, hurt—and that their partner will recognize they are faking it. But if you genuinely want to help your partner, you should be able to find a reward you are comfortable with. Remember, your “real” feelings are complicated. You may love him one minute and hate him the next—or even love him and hate him at the same time. Keep in mind that your objective is to reinforce the change you want to see, and try to connect <a id="page_161"/>with some genuine feelings of warmth, appreciation, and approval to reward positive behavior when you see it.<a id="rfn31"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span><i>If at all possible, choose rewards that expose your partner to healthy alternatives and healthy socializing.</i> If he’s trying to stop smoking pot, get him a membership at a local gym where he can work out and reduce his stress in a healthy way; if he’s trying to stop going out drinking with his buddies every Friday night, work together to discover an alternative activity—getting together with that nice couple you are always saying you want to see more of, going bowling with the whole family. Remember, you want to counter the isolation that often goes hand in hand with dependencies.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>Identify Alternative Behaviors</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">The next step in creating a reinforcing environment involves identifying <i>specific behaviors (or activities) you want to reinforce.</i> But in order to do this, you first need to pinpoint what your partner gets out of his unhealthy dependent behavior (see the following “Short-Term Positive Consequences” exercise) and then identify replacement behaviors that provide the same benefits but also support health and well-being.</p>
<div class="boxgtb">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">SHORT-TERM POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Have your partner answer the following question and write down the answers: What reasons (if any) do you have for using this substance or activity? (Some answers might be to relax, to tune out, or to stop negative thoughts.) The answers to this question are the <i>reinforcers</i> that are already in place.</p>
<p class="indentb"><a id="page_162"/>Next, brainstorm together to create a list of alternative behaviors with similar benefits. If one reason he gets high is to relax, alternative behaviors with similar benefits might include going for a walk or a swim, taking a nap, getting a massage, meditating, or doing yoga.</p>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<p class="indent">You probably have noticed that your partner’s substance use occurs at certain times of the day and/or on certain days. The alternative behaviors that will be most effective at competing with this use pattern are ones that not only fill a similar function, but also can be done during the time he would have spent using. If drinking takes away his inhibitions with people and helps him socialize, on those nights he usually drinks, create other situations in which socializing is less difficult. Consider settings where substances are not allowed or readily available, such as museums, meditation groups, or yoga classes. And try to involve people who don’t use or encourage use.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also important to brainstorm together ways to help your partner make or reinforce family and/or community connections and to build a social life that does not include substances or unhealthy activities. You may have to revisit the past in order to help your partner remember what activities he used to enjoy.</p>
<div class="boxgtb">
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
<h3 class="h3a">{EXERCISE}</h3>
<h4 class="h4c-bs1">EVALUATING REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Once you have created a list of ideas for replacement activities together, have your partner answer the following questions for each alternative, in order to make sure the activity is a good option. We suggest he write down his answers.</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Would I enjoy this alternative (both the actual activity and the benefits it provides)?</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span><a id="page_163"/>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Is it possible I would receive benefits from it that I would otherwise get from using substances?</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Do I think that the alternative activity can replace the substance-using behavior in terms of providing me comfort, stimulation, etc.?</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Does the opportunity to engage in the new behavior occur often enough? (If not, look for behaviors that are routine or repeated on a regular basis, such as weekly classes or daily exercise so that continuation will make a difference over time.)</p>
<p class="bullb"><span class="hide">              </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>Is the new behavior or activity something that both my partner and I can enjoy together? (Since the new life you are building includes both of you, look for activities that are conducive to the two of you spending more time together.)</p>
</div>
<div class="hide"><hr/></div>
</div>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>Offer Extra Encouragement</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">In your role as collaborator, you can reinforce these replacement activities by providing rewards <i>in addition to</i> intrinsic benefits. Since substances are powerful and change is difficult, your partner may need extra encouragement, especially at first. You can offer this encouragement through the examples of kindness we talked about earlier (a hug, a kiss, an encouraging look) or by offering compassionate statements such as:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I know how difficult it has been for you to stop drinking. There must be times when you really suffer because of it. I want you to know I am really proud of you.”</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="hide">      </span>•<span class="space1"/><span class="hide">   </span>“I appreciate the fact that you aren’t spending as much time on the computer, how you turn it off and come to bed with me instead. I’ve really enjoyed talking to you and cuddling together before we go to sleep.”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_164"/>You can also offer encouragement by looking for activities, experiences, or hobbies that are positive and healthy to suggest to him or offer to him to compete with his substance use.</p>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>If You Find Spending Time Together Difficult</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">You may feel too angry or burned out to want to spend time with your partner. If this is the case, start small—choose activities that don’t require you to talk or otherwise engage on too intimate a level, such as going to the movies or going for a bike ride together. You may also feel resistant to spending more time with your partner while he is still using. However, CRAFT studies have consistently shown a connection between enjoying time together and decreased destructive behavior on the part of the person who is substance dependent, as well as an increased sense of well-being for both of you.<a id="rfn32"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn32"><sup>32</sup></a> Spending time together also enhances the collaborative atmosphere you’re building, further supporting your partner’s ability to change.</p>
<p class="indent">A word of caution: Try to resist talking about anything too serious during the time you spend together doing these alternative activities. The focus should be on spending time together that is free of stress and conflict and that will help improve your relationship. You likely have been holding in a lot of feelings, and understandably so, but this is not the time to discuss them. Talk to a friend or practice self-care strategies instead (see <a href="Chapter10.html">chapter 10</a>). You will have other opportunities in the future to share your feelings or have more serious conversations with your partner.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><b>Strategy #3: Provide Negative Consequences</b></h4>
<p class="noindent">Just as you paired positive consequences with positive behaviors to encourage them, you can apply (or allow) negative consequences with negative behaviors to <i>dis</i>courage them.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_165"/>It takes time to stay sober instead of using, to learn to exercise instead of dealing with stress with substances, to leave work instead of continuing to work compulsively, to stop gambling and take up a healthier habit. In the meantime, the following strategies will help you discourage behaviors in your partner that you have both agreed you want him to stop. They are not mutually exclusive, and can be combined for even greater impact.</p>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>Hold Back the Reward You Have Been Using</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">Pick something you can withdraw during or immediately after the negative behavior occurs. This will immediately strengthen the link between the behavior and the consequence. For optimum effectiveness, you will need to reinstate the reward when the positive behavior returns. This may mean that you will need to put aside your hurt or angry feelings about the past slip.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, <i>holding back a reward is not punishment</i>. Punishment is doing something <i>to</i> a person; taking a time out from positive reinforcement is simply not giving something that you gave previously for positive behavior. It’s also temporary—the reward will be given again very soon. But holding back a reward allows you to respond to negative behavior in a way that avoids a fight or other negative action on your part, leaving it up to your partner to learn the consequences of his choices.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, your partner may have told you that one reward he would like is a home-cooked meal on Saturday nights. You may have agreed to do this as long as he continues to not smoke pot. So, on a night when you come home to the smell of pot in the house, instead of confronting him about his slip, yelling at him, or giving him the silent treatment, you simply say, “Oh, I see that you’ve smoked pot today, so I’m not going to cook this Saturday. You can go for take-out or we’ll eat leftovers.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_166"/>It is your choice whether you tell your partner about your plan to withhold a reward or not, but communicating your plan can help reduce the emotionality of your partner’s response.</p>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>Allow the Natural Negative Consequences That Result from a Negative Behavior</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">Natural consequences are the direct outcomes of your partner’s substance use that he would experience if no one interfered or rescued him. These outcomes can include emotional costs such as shame, loss of control, anger, or depression; physical costs such as loss of sleep, hangover, poor health, or injury; and other costs such as loss of relationships, loss of a job, financial difficulties, and legal problems. For example, if your partner wakes up too hung over to go to work after a night of drinking, don’t call his boss for him and say that he is sick.</p>
<p class="indent">Note that just as a reward is only as reinforcing as its value to the person receiving it, a consequence will impact your partner only if he experiences it as a drawback. If your partner hates his job and is looking for a new one, he won’t view losing it as a negative consequence. In order to be effective, negative consequences need to be compelling reasons for your partner to stop his current behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">As you allow your partner to experience these natural consequences, be aware of your facial expression, your tone of voice, and your body language. This strategy works best if you are as matter of fact as possible rather than becoming angry or righteous; you certainly don’t want to say (or imply) <i>I told you so</i>. A punitive attitude interferes with the collaborative relationship necessary for positive change.</p>
<p class="indent">If done correctly, this strategy helps your partner focus his or her stress, frustration, and resistance <i>within himself</i>, rather than between the two of you. Allow him to come face to face—the literal meaning of “confront”—with the results of his own actions instead of blaming you.</p>
<h5 class="h5s"><a id="page_167"/><b><i>Ignore the Negative Behavior</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">Ignoring your partner’s behavior gives the least amount of reinforcement possible—no reward, no response, no attention at all. Typically, when a behavior is not reinforced, it is gradually extinguished.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t confuse this with giving the cold shoulder or the silent treatment, or other ways of communicating displeasure. Ignoring says <i>I am not interested in this behavior</i>, whereas giving the cold shoulder says, <i>I’m angry with you</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not recommended that you ignore substance use very often, as withdrawing rewards and allowing consequences are more effective strategies. Ignoring is helpful for dealing with your partner’s reactions to the other strategies, however—particularly if your partner begins swearing, sulking, or yelling, or says some version of “Why are you doing this to me?!” If you respond to these negative reactions in any way, you in essence reinforce them.</p>
<p class="indent">A word of warning: Sometimes ignoring a behavior initially results in an escalation of the behavior, a phenomena referred to as <i>behavioral burst.</i> This doesn’t tend to last very long and can actually signal an upcoming end to the behavior. The best way to deal with this period is to just ride it out, because if you respond to a burst, your partner may learn that if he pushes you hard enough, you will give in—that his behavior (swearing, sulking, yelling) still works. The most effective way of dealing with a burst is to ignore it and then, the moment he stops, to give him positive reinforcement in the form of your attention.</p>
<h5 class="h5s"><b><i>If You Are Uncomfortable with This Strategy</i></b></h5>
<p class="noindent">You may feel uncomfortable with strategy #3—if so, you aren’t alone. Many people don’t like thinking of themselves as a “trainer” of someone they love. Some feel this behavioral approach is manipulative or <a id="page_168"/>dishonest. But having a specific plan for change that you and your partner have both agreed to isn’t the same as scheming or manipulating. In fact, there is evidence that a behavioral approach is one of the most respectful, authentic ones you can use, as it takes a fundamentally collaborative, nonjudgmental approach to learning and change.<a id="rfn33"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Think of it this way: We influence each other in every interaction we have; reinforcement takes place between people all the time, whether it is done consciously or unconsciously. You are probably already trying to influence your partner’s behavior by giving him the silent treatment or yelling at him as forms of punishment. Unfortunately, these kinds of responses create a negative reinforcement loop. As you obsess about your partner’s problem and carry your distress around with you, you naturally end up nagging, withdrawing, and behaving in other punishing ways—<i>even when he is not using</i>. Your anger about the last time he used can spill over to the next day, or even days later. It is not uncommon for people with substance problems to get the same punishing reaction whether they are using or not.<a id="rfn34"/><a href="Endnote.html#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Not only does this kind of behavior not work to decrease the substance use, it can influence your partner’s decision to continue using. He may reason that since he gets yelled at when he uses and yelled at when he doesn’t, there’s no reason <i>not</i> to use.</p>

<p class="noindent">Some of the CRAFT program strategies may feel more comfortable or applicable for you and your partner than others, so start off with the most useful ones. Then let these strategies spark other creative ideas for how you and your partner can collaborate to help him recover.</p>
