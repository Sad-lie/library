<h3 class="h3a"><b>FROM CHRIS</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">That amazing human interaction we call romantic love can be magical. But relationships are also challenging; even in the best of circumstances, they can be as rife with pitfalls as they are with possibilities. When you add addiction to the mix, you have the potential for frustration, anger, and pain—in a word, failure.</p>
<p class="indent">But it doesn’t have to be that way, and that’s what these pages will show.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important qualification I have for coauthoring a book about relationships with individuals recovering from substance or behavioral addiction is my own experience recovering from these disorders for the past thirty years. As a person in long-term recovery, I’ve found that maintaining solid, fulfilling relationships has been an enormous challenge, though I’ve never stopped trying. Maybe that’s why relationships and human development are so fascinating to me. And that fascination is one of the reasons I do the work I do today.</p>
<p class="indent">After spending twenty years in the film and television industries as an actor, lawyer, executive, and producer, I wrote three <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books dealing with addiction, <i>Symptoms of Withdrawal</i> (2005), <i>Moments of Clarity</i> (2009), and <i>Recover to Live</i> (2013), and, more recently, <i>What Addicts Know</i> (2014). I have campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the recovery community in both the public and private sectors, holding appointed positions with the California <a id="page_2"/>Public Health Advisory Committee and serving as goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to promote activities supporting drug treatment, care, and recovery. In addition, I earned a master’s certification in clinical psychology from Harvard Medical School, where I held an academic appointment as a lecturer in psychiatry, and I currently speak around the world on issues related to addiction and mental health.</p>
<p class="indent">Recovery from any addiction, as I know too well from my own experience and from the stories I’ve heard from others in my work, is a lifelong process. The learning never ends. It takes most of us a lifetime to establish and maintain a stable, mutually nurturing, and rewarding relationship with someone we love and, even then, we don’t always do it well. The past traumas and family of origin dysfunction that cause or contribute to addiction, the fanciful thinking, and sometimes just the stuff we arrive on the planet with often combine to derail our most ardent and committed intentions. This is why having compassion for your partner is so important. No one consciously chooses addiction to a substance or a behavior over his partner. There are always reasons—powerful ones—why a person retreats into addiction. Understanding that not only adds to your compassion, but brings you closer to experiencing true intimacy with your partner.</p>
<p class="indent">There was a time when I believed that a person in recovery who had successfully put away the chemicals was destined to find the love of his life and live happily ever after. I was wrong. It took my first fourteen years of recovery before I fully grasped how profound my issues were in the realm of love, sex, and intimacy. Addiction is often a solution, if a poor one, to deeper issues; those of us who struggle with substance or behavioral addiction are either medicating the intolerableness of our existence or trying to touch the hand of God in an insatiable quest for a more thrilling life. Love and relationships can be used in the same way. But they don’t have to be.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_3"/>You can’t make someone get help or go into recovery when they don’t want to do it. Pushing, prodding, threatening—they don’t work. Putting that kind of pressure on someone usually just makes things worse. Why? Because they aren’t ready. I believe that all of us, not just people struggling with addiction, get intermittent windows of opportunity to change our lives. We wake up one day and something happens that allows us to say to ourselves: I’m going to change my life. <i>I’m going to get sober. I’m going to be a good father and a good husband.</i> I tried everything on the planet to get sober for about nine years. I was significantly motivated to change my life, yet I still couldn’t do it. Then one day I saw a window of opportunity and I crawled through. I can tell you from experience that when that window opens, you need all the motivation and all the tools you can muster in that moment to crawl through. Whatever gets you there is good. And love can be a powerful motivator.</p>
<p class="indent">This book will show you how your actions—your love and compassion—can help your partner take advantage of his<sup><a id="rfn0"/><a href="#fn0">*</a></sup> windows for change, and fortify him for the challenges he’ll face in recovery. We won’t excuse or minimize the harm and pain he has caused you. But we do want to bring hope and promise back into your lives, and strength and possibility into your relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">You’re in a relationship with someone who struggles with addiction, so you already know it’s hard. What you might not yet know is why. Most of us don’t ever closely examine why we choose the people <a id="page_4"/>we do to populate our lives. We’re intimidated, and hesitant to ask the penetrating questions. We prefer not to look too closely at where we came from and at what effect the baggage we inherited has on those we choose to love. Making the choice to stay with your partner means confronting those things head-on.</p>
<p class="indent">Believe me, it’s a hard road. There’s an easier one: Kick your partner to the curb and try to move on. There are situations where you absolutely should do this; we’ll discuss those in this book. But in many cases, taking that easy road is not going to get you a profound human experience. It’s not necessarily going to help <i>you</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">If you picked a person with an addiction to be in relationship with, you probably have some issues of your own. You picked your current partner for a reason, and until you understand that reason and take responsibility for the ways in which you’ve co-created your situation, you’re just going to pick people like him over and over again. You have the choice to leave, but you will end up back here again.</p>
<p class="indent">The good news is that your partner is giving you an opportunity to deal with your issues. People who struggle with addiction have a way of lifting up a mirror to everyone they have relationships with, thereby revealing others’ dysfunctions. Your partner will show you yours, and if he is in recovery, doing the work to change, he will challenge you to change as well. (Marriages that break up once a partner gets sober often do so because the other person isn’t ready to look at their own issues.) By staying and helping your partner, especially if you follow the guidance in this book, you’ll be helping yourself as well. You will begin the process of revealing your own authentic humanness. And the rewards for that journey can be greater than you ever imagined or could have predicted. Being involved in your partner’s recovery can be one of the greatest emotional, spiritual, and physical experiences of your life.</p>
<p class="indent">Relationships are confusing, they’re exhausting, they’re risky. But that’s how we learn how to be better human beings. There is no <a id="page_5"/>greater classroom on humanity than the classroom of a relationship, and learning how to be in an intimate, loving partnership is the PhD program of becoming a fully realized human being. You may have picked up this book because you wanted to help your partner and improve your relationship—and we’ll show you how to do that. But we’ll also show you how to better understand yourself, and begin to live a more fulfilled and meaningful life.</p>
<p class="indent">This book shows you how to be in a relationship without being hopelessly codependent. It shows you how to be a true partner to someone whose secrecy and isolation often feel insurmountable. And it shows you, above all, how compassion can change your relationship, and your life.</p>
<h3 class="h3t"><b>FROM BEVERLY</b></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you are married to or romantically involved with someone who is dependent on alcohol or drugs or suffers from compulsive behavior, including gambling, shopping, sex, pornography, overeating, or work, and you want to discover the best ways to help him, this book is for you.</p>
<p class="indent">You may have read other books about being in a relationship with someone struggling with addiction. But this book will be unlike anything you’ve read before. We will not blame you for your partner’s problems or tell you that you are “enabling” him if you continue to support him. Instead of telling you to either stand aside or run away, we are going to tell you how you can walk beside your partner and help him on his journey to recovery—without falling into the trap of being codependent.</p>
<p class="indent">In these pages we challenge the way society looks at those who are dependent on a substance or an activity; instead of demonizing them, we take a close look at why they are who they are and do what <a id="page_6"/>they do. We pull back the bandages of addiction and look at the wounds underneath in order to help you gain true compassion for your addicted partner’s suffering. And instead of focusing on their flaws, we look at their strengths and their gifts.</p>
<p class="indent">We also challenge the way society looks at the partners of those who are dependent on a substance or activity. Instead of viewing them as long-suffering victims who put up with unacceptable behavior because they themselves are flawed or inadequate or desperate to not be alone, we focus on their strengths and gifts as well, and share strategies for redirecting those strengths and gifts to help heal their own wounds as well as their partners’.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll learn skills that will help you communicate more effectively, more positively, and more compassionately, so you can transform your relationship with your partner. You’ll also discover, as Chris said, why you chose your partner in the first place and what you need to learn about yourself in order to change your own unhealthy thinking and behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">Like many other partners of someone with a dependence problem, you may feel a longing to bring up the issue of your partner’s addiction but are afraid to broach the subject. You may fear angering him or making the situation worse. You may have tried before only to be rebuffed or blamed for his problems. In this book we will help you learn how to let your partner know you are concerned without shaming him or making him angry, and how to communicate with him in a way that will encourage him to listen. Then, once your partner is open to hearing you, you can try our strategies for helping him in his efforts to stop his unhealthy behaviors. In these pages we share the most up-to-date research about substance and activity dependence, what works and what doesn’t as far as recovery is concerned, as well as the most effective avenues for recovery, so you can pass on this information to your partner.</p>
<p class="indent">The typical advice given to partners of those suffering from an addiction is to either end the relationship or stop trying to change <a id="page_7"/>the addict and accept him the way he is. This book offers you a third option: becoming your partner’s supporter or collaborator as he makes changes for himself. We want to let you know that you can, in fact, help your loved one change. And we will show you, step by step, how to go about it.</p>
<p class="indent">While the information we offer doesn’t contradict what you might learn at an Al-Anon or Co-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA) meeting, it will add to what you may think you know about those who are addicted and how to relate to them. It takes the Al-Anon message one step further, helping you love your partner in a deeper, more compassionate way.</p>
<p class="indent">For those of you who have nearly reached your limit in terms of how much you can take, we offer suggestions that will help you <i>back off</i> without <i>backing out</i> of the relationship altogether. We will help you communicate your limits without arguing, yelling, or resorting to emotional blackmail. And for those of you who are truly on the fence, we will help you make a decision you can live with and not regret. Most importantly, we will help you do all this while taking care of <i>yourself</i> in the process.</p>
<p class="indent">We offer exercises throughout the book, and it has been our experience that those who complete the exercises tend to benefit more than those who don’t. Overall, however, we encourage you to take in what seems beneficial to you and bypass anything that doesn’t.</p>
<p class="indent">I come to this project with thirty-five years of experience working with hundreds of couples as a psychotherapist and a marriage and family therapist. One of the primary reasons couples come to see me is because one partner has an addiction or dependence problem and the other doesn’t know whether to stay in the relationship or end it. I am also one of the world’s leading experts in the treatment of emotional abuse, something partners of those with dependence problems are often dealing with. In this book I offer you the same advice I offer my clients, as well as provide some case examples in order to help you recognize that you are not alone.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_8"/>One thing I discovered in my work with such couples, well before the connection became recognized and accepted in the addiction field, was that those who were abused or neglected in childhood are far more likely to become addicted or dependent on alcohol or drugs than the rest of the population. So, while I am not an addiction expert—that’s Chris—I <i>am</i> an expert in helping those who were abused or neglected make that all-important connection between the abuse they experienced in childhood and their addiction, and realize that it is <i>understandable</i> that they would turn to a substance or an activity as a way of coping with the trauma they experienced. Realizing this can be the difference between continuing to blame and shame themselves and gaining self-compassion—an essential step in recovering from the abuse and from the way they chose to self-medicate.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve seen, over and over, in my clients as well as in the research, the difference that compassion can make in a person’s life. And in this book, I use my experience to help you offer your partner compassion and understanding in a way that can save not only his life, but yours as well.</p>

<p class="foot"><a id="fn0"/><a href="#rfn0">*</a> Throughout this book, we’ve used the pronoun “he” for those who suffer from a substance or activity dependency. This is done for simplicity’s sake only. We recognize that there are also many women who suffer from dependency and addiction problems and that their partners are in just as much need of this book. In addition, although all the case examples in the book are male-female couples and we often use “she” in referring to the partners of those who suffer from substance or activity dependency, the information in this book applies to any couple, regardless of its members’ genders.</p>
