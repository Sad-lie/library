For the moment, he was all SRI would need, and even twenty-three years later, in conversations with me, Hal Puthoff and former intelligence officials who had overseen the SRI program would shake their heads and swear that they had never seen another psychic as good as he.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos322442"></a>I was shown a photograph taken after one of Price’s many triumphs. The scene is a small airfield, the backdrop the coastal foothills of northern California. Close to the camera, Richard Kennett, Hal Puthoff, and Pat Price lean against a smoothly aerodynamic-looking <a id="filepos322723"></a>glider.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">That day, Kennett had wanted to test Price against a moving target. So while Price and Puthoff stayed on the ground, Kennett had gone up in the glider. In his shirt pocket he carried the target, a small piece of paper bearing a sequence of three numbers. The glider was towed aloft, soared around for a while, and then landed. Kennett got out and went over to Price.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">No problem, said Price, and he showed Kennett the three numbers he had written down. They were the correct target numbers, and they were also in the right sequence. The only thing, indicated Price, was that the whole exercise had made him a bit queasy. He had been able to picture the numbers in his mind’s eye, but behind them there had been this strange shape swinging back and forth. It had seemed to disorient his vestibular system, almost making him seasick. He drew the shape. It looked like an Egyptian cross, an “ankh.” Kennett laughed, reached inside his shirt, and pulled out an ornamental silver ankh he kept on a cord around his neck. With the rolls and yaws of the sailplane, it had pendulated across his chest behind the numbers in his shirt pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The photograph was taken just afterwards. Kennett is on the left, and Puthoff is on the right. Both grin happily in the low light of late afternoon, and between them, arms crossed, is Pat Price, with the slight, sure smile of the cat who has just eaten the canary.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Over the next year or so the CIA’s Office of Technical Service and Office of Research and Development would pump about $150,000 into SRI’s remote-viewing project. There were also two small contracts with the Navy and NASA, <a id="filepos324679"></a>plus money left over from private grants for the Geller research.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By Washington standards, a few hundred thousand dollars spread over a few years was hardly even spare change. But psi research itself was very cheap to conduct, and SRI had enough to get by. Even so, it was made clear to Puthoff and Targ that major funding would come only when they began to publish some of their psi experiments in reputable scientific journals. Not only would this encourage senior intelligence officials to take them more seriously, but it also would boost their standing among ordinary scientists, who sat on government science advisory boards and grant review committees, and in general decided what was and wasn’t “science.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But winning over the scientific community would prove to be a near-impossible task. Although Puthoff and Targ were soon writing hopefully that “<a id="filepos325717"></a>many consider the study of these phenomena as only recently emerging from the realm of quasi-science,” they had it backward. Psi research had once been considered “scientific,” but since the late nineteenth century, scientific institutions had gradually been organizing it out of the picture.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Psi research in the modern era emerged from the same womb that modern psychiatry did. It began in the late 1700s with the study of the “Mesmeric trance,” “magnetic sleep,” and “artificial somnambulism”—all of which we now call “hypnosis.” Dabblers in hypnosis quickly discovered that people who were very good at being hypnotized also seemed to be very good at “preternatural” skills like clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and even a kind of shamanic healing ability. Many of these talented “somnambules” and “clairvoyantes” were as celebrated as today’s big-name psychics. By the 1840s, hypnosis-related psi abilities were so common that they had become a sort of parlor trick. English gentlemen would hypnotize their maidservants, showing off the girls’ clairvoyant skills to dinner party guests.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a></a>The hypnosis craze soon gave way to a craze over a form of self-hypnosis—and theatrics—known as “spiritism” or “spiritualism.” By the mid nineteenth century, thousands of spirit “mediums” were giving performances throughout America and Europe. These mediums supposedly spoke with the voices of entities from the supernatural world, levitated tables and other furniture, and transcribed—in trance, through “automatic writing”—the voluminous teachings of their familiar spirits. As such, they were a throwback to a much more ancient type of individual: the shaman, or the devotee of a possession cult, for whom “possession” by spirits, typically before an audience, was a form of social and psychological empowerment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Most if not all nineteenth-century psi researchers seemed unaware of this ancient connection. To many of them, mediumship was new and mysterious, and deserved intense study. Even some who did not believe in or care for psi phenomena thought mediums worth investigation, realizing that their séance-room performances might at least shed light on the workings of the normally hidden subconscious. As a result, mediums became the focus of considerable psychological and psychiatric research,<a id="filepos328485" href="#filepos354090">*</a> at the same time that they and their séances helped spawn numerous organizations devoted to psi research.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The most famous psi research group of the era was the Society for Psychical Research, founded in London in 1882. The SPR’s members included the psychologist Frederic Myers, the Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick, the physiologist Charles Richet, the physicists Sir William Crookes and Sir Oliver Lodge, the poet William Butler Yeats, and the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. An array of such luminaries would be hard for psi researchers to assemble today.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Yet despite their prestigious membership, and their prolific, <a id="filepos329320"></a>high-profile, and sometimes hard-nosed investigations, the SPR and its cousins around the world were unable to establish psi firmly within the Western scientific worldview. The problem was, by the time psychical research began to come of age, the chaos and ferment that had characterized much of nineteenth-century science were already ending. Theories of nature—especially those regarding electromagnetism and the behavior of the atom—were hardening into laws of nature. And those laws, by most interpretations, just didn’t admit that the human mind could span time and space unaided, remotely experiencing events and affecting matter. It became increasingly fashionable among scientists to portray psi as a primitive, retrograde fantasy which modernity was swiftly leaving behind.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In response to this worsening intellectual climate, psychical research began to transform itself into something more academic and mundane, the better to blend in with other scientific disciplines. The late J. B. <a id="filepos330416"></a>Rhine is generally credited with this transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Rhine was an eager young botanist, a natural scientist and a native of academia, when on an evening in Chicago in 1922 he heard Arthur Conan Doyle lecture enthusiastically about psychical research. Doyle seemed to strike some hidden chord inside the young scientist, and along with his wife Louisa, also a botanist, Rhine decided to embark on a new career.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Psychical research at the time was still dominated by the study of séance mediums, whose theatrical displays usually took place in the dark, under conditions that they themselves could substantially control. Rhine, by contrast, was used to working with much more compliant subjects of study, such as the leaves and stems and cells of plants. After sitting for a séance in Boston with the famous medium Mina “Margery” Crandon, he was infuriated. To him the <a></a>entire thing had been a grotesque farce, an outrage against science.<a id="filepos331539" href="#filepos354307">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">And so, wielding the tablets of scientific method, Rhine led psychical researchers into a promised land of university laboratories and experimental rigor, of dry statistics and subjects who did what they were told to do. Psychical research became “parapsychology,” and at the Duke University Parapsychology Laboratory, which Rhine founded in 1930, mediumistic monkeying-about was banished. Research subjects instead took part in lengthy card-guessing or dice-throwing experiments, the object being to generate significant statistical evidence that the results were not merely due to the whims of chance.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Rhine and other parapsychologists produced a great deal of such evidence. Their methods were blessed by statisticians, and <em class="calibre4">Time</em> and <em class="calibre4">Reader’s Digest</em> and <em class="calibre4">Scientific American</em> took an interest, and ripples of confusion and wonderment spread throughout the scientific community. By the 1960s and the Age of Aquarius, it seemed that psi research might even become an orthodox scientific discipline again. Everyone was talking about paradigm shifts and changes in consciousness. Popular belief in psi was sky-high. Surely scientific belief would follow. In 1969, after a rousing conference speech by the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the American Association for the Advancement of Science voted to admit psi researchers’ main professional organization, the Parapsychological Association, to its ranks of approved disciplines.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But the <a id="filepos333295"></a>paradigm failed to shift. The “laws” of nature, which had long endured the anomalies and paradoxes thrown up by such things as quantum physics, were not <a id="filepos333470"></a>about to be overturned by a few dozen dice throwers and card guessers in ill-funded laboratories.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Instead, an informal system of scientific apartheid was set up. Parapsychologists officially were allowed to call themselves scientists, but in practice were kept out of the scientific community. They found themselves ignored, ghettoized, forced to subsist on handouts from private philanthropists, forced to publish their work only in their own obscure and inconsequential journals.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It was relatively easy for the skeptics to get away with this, for somehow the parapsychologists never seemed to have anything to show for their work other than statistical evidence, usually marginal, in favor of whatever psi phenomenon they were studying. There was quite a discrepancy between these anesthetic tabulations on the one hand, and on the other the outrageous, seemingly boundless promise of psi. By caging psi in the laboratory, the parapsychologists seemed to have reduced it to an abstract curiosity. Where, the skeptics could ask tauntingly, were the machines, the technologies, that would run on psi? Where were the real-world applications? What was the <em class="calibre4">use</em> of it all?</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ironically, and frustratingly for Puthoff and Targ, that use was now highly classified. The most powerful weapon in psi’s evidentiary arsenal—psychic spying on intelligence targets—could not be used to convince ordinary academic scientists.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ therefore decided that alongside their more hush-hush work with long-distance clairvoyance, they would experiment with an ESP technique that was related but had less obvious intelligence applications. The technique had the further advantage that it did not involve geographical coordinates. Puthoff and Targ still regarded the use of coordinates as scientifically and metaphysically dubious, even though it somehow seemed to work.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The new protocol relied on a person who would act as <a id="filepos335777"></a>an “outbound” experimenter, visiting the target site while the psychic, back at SRI, tried to visualize the experimenter’s surroundings. After the session, the psychic himself could actually visit the target site, thus getting a richer feedback than was usually possible with classified coordinate targets—for which feedback was often no more than a smile and a pat on the back.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The first formal test of this “outbound” protocol occurred on the afternoon of <a id="filepos336357"></a>October 4, 1973,<a id="filepos336381" href="#filepos354691">*</a> and went about as well as Puthoff and Targ could have hoped. Pat Price was taken by Russell Targ into an experiment room, and both men sat down at a table. At the same time Puthoff and his SRI branch chief, a man named Earle Jones, went over to the office of their division chief, Bart Cox. Cox had a long list of possible target sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. He generated a random number with his calculator, used it to select a target site from the list, pulled out the appropriate file with directions to the site, and handed it to Puthoff. Puthoff took the file, went with Jones to his car, opened the file, and followed the enclosed directions to the target, which was Hoover Tower on the Stanford University campus, in nearby Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Jones looked around, went up the tower to an observation deck, and generally tried to soak up sensations at the site, the better to serve as ESP “beacons” for Price. At an agreed-upon time, back at SRI, Price tried to visualize where Puthoff and Jones were standing. “I get them on a ridge or bluff overlooking the ocean,” he said initially. “I would say they are about four hundred feet <a id="filepos337691"></a>above sea level.… I had a flash of being in a room with a Spanish-tile floor and a colonnade, about three miles south of here. Outside the colonnades I get the feeling that it’s a library or a museum-type area with an exhibit there. I was just looking around. The area I have seems like it would be Hoover Tower.…”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">It was soon clear to Puthoff that Price’s results were going to be much more robust than the usual parapsychological fare. They represented a break with the past. And to underscore this break with the past, Puthoff decided to invent a new terminology for the kinds of psi phenomena Price was demonstrating. As far as Puthoff was concerned, the old terms such as <em class="calibre4">clairvoyance, ESP</em>, and <em class="calibre4">psychic perception</em> carried unwanted baggage, full of hysterical mediums, palm readers, and all those dead, dry card-guessing experiments at Duke University. Puthoff wanted something that sounded new and modern, technological and sober, something that would blend unobtrusively with the jargon of the hard sciences. Over the next few years he and Targ would use a <a id="filepos338887"></a>variety of expressions to describe what was going on such as: “information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding,” “a perceptual channel for information transfer over kilometer distances,” “perceptual augmentation techniques,” “remote perceptual abilities,” and “remote perception.” Eventually Puthoff came up with the punchier “remote viewing,” and after a while, that name stuck.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ used modifiers to distinguish one remote-viewing technique from another. The outbound method became “outbound remote viewing.” Swann’s coordinate-based method was called “coordinate remote viewing” (CRV). Deeper altered-state methods, such as those favored by the unit at Fort Meade, would be given the term “extended remote viewing” (ERV).</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In October 1973 Puthoff and Targ did nine outbound experiments with Price, involving nine separate target sites. <a id="filepos340038"></a>Afterwards a judge who hadn’t participated in any of the previous experiments (a “blind” judge, in experimenter’s parlance) went out to the sites with copies of Price’s transcripts in hand, and tried to match each site to one of the transcripts. He matched transcripts to seven of the nine sites correctly. Had mere chance been at work, argued Puthoff and Targ, there should only have been about one correct match per judge. The odds that chance had produced seven correct matches, they said, were roughly one in 35,000.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Here and there Puthoff and Targ varied the variables. Sometimes they put Price in an electrically shielded “Faraday cage” for his outbound remote-viewing sessions, just to test the hypothesis that psi worked via some sort of radio waves. Most of the time they used an ordinary room at SRI. A couple of times they sat Price on a bench in a busy park. Or they used moving targets, as in the glider demonstration. It didn’t seem to matter. Price blithely knocked off target after target.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ also tested Price for psychokinetic ability, and he did reasonably well. He seemed able to affect the swing rate of a brass clock pendulum, and also apparently perturbed—albeit marginally—a small SRI magnetometer that had defied Swann. In one bizarre demonstration, a researcher named Karlis Osis at the American Society for Psychical Research in New York set up a small copper box inside a locked room; within the box, a feather was monitored for the slightest motion by an infrared beam and photocell. When Price, a continent away, turned his attention to the target, the infrared sensor went off.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But most of Price’s feats centered on remote viewing. There were some very strange episodes. One day Russell Targ and another SRI official named Hugh Crane were sitting with Price in the Faraday cage, waiting to do session number four of Price’s celebrated nine-session run. Puthoff and his division chief Bart Cox were the outbound experimenters. <a></a>Cox, still vaguely skeptical about remote viewing, decided on this day to change the protocol, to assure himself that Puthoff and Targ weren’t somehow colluding with Price. Instead of going to the target selected for him at the lab, he would simply drive around, making turns according a pseudo-random algorithm that took into account the turns made by the cars in front of him. At the appointed time, he would stop somewhere and wait. He and Puthoff left at three in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At ten past three, back in the remote-viewing room with Price, Targ switched on the tape recorder, and went through the usual routine of naming the experimenters, the viewer, the date, the time, and when the outbound experimenters would arrive at their target site, which was three-thirty.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“We don’t have to wait that long,” interrupted Price, as Targ switched the recorder off. “I can tell you right now where they’ll be.” Targ switched the recorder back on. “What I’m looking at,” Price continued, “is a little boat jetty or a little boat dock along the bay.” He pointed to one of the walls of the shielded room. “In a direction about like that from here. Yeah, I see the little boats, some motor launches, some sailing ships, sails all furled, some with masts stepped and others are up. Little jetty or dock there …”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Cox ended up at the Redwood City Marina, in the direction Price had indicated, with the boats Price had described in view. But the really strange thing was, their aimless meanderings had not taken them to the marina until about five minutes after Price had described it. Price apparently had stretched his perception not only across space, but across time as well.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ were astounded by that, but it would eventually come to seem like a fairly tame example of a remote viewer slipping through time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The last target in Price’s nine-target series was a pair of <a id="filepos344691"></a>public swimming pools at Rinconada Park in Palo Alto. Price described the sizes and the shapes of the two pools accurately—one was round, one rectangular—and even detected a small concrete blockhouse nearby. But to Puthoff and Targ’s dismay, he interpreted the site as a water-treatment plant, and added something that wasn’t at the site at all: a set of two large elevated water tanks. Although Price’s description was still easy for a judge to match to the site, Puthoff and Targ assumed that the water-treatment idea and the large tanks were figments of Price’s imagination. Then one day, twenty-one and a half years later, Targ happened to read the 1995 annual report of the city of Palo Alto. In a discussion celebrating the city’s hundredth year, the report mentioned: “In 1913 a new municipal waterworks was built on the site of the present Rinconada Park.” An accompanying photograph showed a tower with two water tanks, more or less in the place Price had described them.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Puthoff and Targ came to believe that Pat Price’s feats, however mind-blowing, were merely extreme variants of an ability that everyone had to one degree or another. The two scientists even considered themselves moderately psychic; both had had spontaneous ESP experiences, precognitive dreams, and so on. And they would find, over the next decade, hundreds of other seemingly ordinary people who had strong psychic talents.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Initially, in late 1973 and early 1974, they focussed their research on four of these ordinary people, three of whom were SRI employees: a lab technician named Phyllis Cole; a mathematician named Marshall Pease; and a futurologist—an economic and cultural trend watcher—named Duane Elgin. Elgin did so well in remote-viewing tests that he moved on to other psi experiments, sitting for more than 7,000 trials on Targ’s ESP teaching machine, and even trying his hand at psychokinesis.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos346894"></a>The fourth ordinary person was Hella Hammid, a photographer friend of Russell Targ and his wife. The German-born Hella was in her early fifties, had somewhere left behind a husband and children, was temperamental, artistic, bisexual,<a id="filepos347135" href="#filepos355237">*</a> a social animal, an interesting character, but was not steeped in psi experiences as Swann and Price had been. She arrived on the scene in 1974, and turned out to have anything but ordinary psi abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ put Hammid through a nine-site series of outbound remote-viewing trials, like Price’s. The judge matched only five of her transcripts correctly. But for a given target, each transcript was “ranked” by the judge from one to nine, according to how well it corresponded to the target. Hammid’s four “missed” sessions all were ranked second by the judge. (Price’s two misses, by contrast, had been way off, ranked third and sixth.) The overall odds that Hammid’s results had happened by chance, as Puthoff calculated it, were about 500,000 to one, which was actually far better than Price had done.<a id="filepos348156"></a>†</p>
<p class="calibre_14">All things considered, including coordinate remote viewing, Hammid wasn’t quite as good as Price, but she was close, and she seemed able to keep up with him in a number of specific categories, such as precognitive remote viewing. One day Hammid was in the remote-viewing room with Russell Targ. Puthoff had just left to get a site from Earle Jones, their branch chief. Hammid for some reason was impatient to get the experiment over with, so she told Targ she already knew what the site was going to be. She proceeded to describe it, and then left. Her description had not only been accurate, but apparently had been made even before the site had been selected by random-number generator.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After one or two episodes like that, Puthoff and Targ developed a new protocol. Puthoff would drive around with a set of ten possible sites in sealed envelopes. Hammid would sit in the viewing room with Targ. At a prearranged time, Hammid would try to view the site precognitively. She would then go home. At a later prearranged time, Puthoff would take out his pocket calculator and, using the random-number function, would generate a number between zero and nine, selecting a site on this basis. He would then drive to the site, wait there for a specified time, and return. Hammid did four sites like this. Blind judging matched all her transcripts to the targets.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Puthoff and Targ tried just about everything in those early years at SRI. With the idea that psi information would often be too subtle to register consciously, they tried to augment ordinary telepathy with electroencephalograph (EEG) devices. The “sender” would sit in one room, blasted by a strobe light that would force his brain waves into a certain pattern. The “receiver” would sit in another, electrically shielded room, wired with an EEG to see if her own brain waves responded to the sender’s. It was a souped-up version of the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> story, the idea being to interest the CIA or the Navy in a possible telepathic system for long-distance communication, perhaps with submerged submarine crews.<a id="filepos350501" href="#filepos356195">*</a> Unfortunately, the experiment didn’t <a id="filepos350598"></a>seem to work as well as Puthoff and Targ had hoped. They tried six receivers, but only Hammid’s EEG patterns seemed to change when the sender was trying to send psi information. Even then, the change wasn’t useful. Her brain waves, instead of mimicking the sender’s, merely showed slightly depressed “alpha” rhythms and slightly enhanced “beta” rhythms, indicating a mild and nonspecific response to a stimulus. Somewhere down in her mind the actual stimulus seemed to be seeping in, but at a level too deep to be reached by the EEG equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ also tried a wide variety of remote-viewing experiments. They asked Pat Price to try to psychically distinguish envelopes with ordinary pencil drawings inside from those with drawings done in special CIA <a id="filepos351492"></a>invisible inks (he did better than chance, but not perfectly).<a id="filepos351562" href="#filepos356483">*</a> They asked Price and other subjects to remote-view targets on computer disks, or the internal states of silicon chip random-number generators. They had them try to visualize objects in little boxes, or in arrays of cubbyholes, or in film canisters; Hella Hammid was the queen of remote viewers when it came to film canisters. They also did successful remote-viewing experiments in which the subjects sat in a deep-diving <a id="filepos352036"></a>submersible off the southern California coast, and tried to visualize outbound sites in the San Francisco area. They even had Price and Hammid remote-view Puthoff when he was on vacation in Central America—and one day, when neither showed up, Targ himself stood in for them and nailed Puthoff’s location on a small island air-strip, <a id="filepos352391"></a>where Puthoff had unexpectedly taken a short side trip.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">They used technological targets, from photocopiers and power supplies to local sewage-treatment plants. They tried associative remote viewing (ARV) in which objects or geographic locations were used as surrogates for letters and numbers. They ran psychokinesis experiments with magnetometers and pendulums. They used Targ’s ESP teaching machine to test a group of one hundred local schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And eventually they got some of this work published. In November 1974, amid much controversy, their first paper appeared in <em class="calibre4">Nature</em>, describing work with Geller, Price, Hammid, and the others. A year and a half later, they published an even longer paper in the prestigious electrical engineering society journal, <em class="calibre4">Proceedings of the IEEE</em>. The editor of the journal, Bell Labs scientist <a id="filepos353406"></a>Robert Lucky, had initially been inclined to turn the paper down. But after Puthoff and Targ had visited Bell Labs to answer questions from skeptical scientists, Lucky was more impressed. Eventually he tried some of his own informal remote-viewing experiments, and decided that remote viewing was probably for real. A journalist would one day quote him as saying, “<a id="filepos353786"></a>Psychic stuff is really not much more far-fetched than some of the physics behind the laser.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ were beginning to make progress.</p>

She is said to have had “affairs” with several of her more prominent supporters in the psychical research community.</p>
<p id="filepos354691" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos336381">*</a> Puthoff, in recent public comments on the early history of remote viewing, has suggested that outbound experiments came first, before coordinate remote-viewing experiments. As I’ve established from an examination of the record and from conversations with him and with Ingo Swann, this isn’t quite accurate. The first record of an outbound experiment is from October 1973, six months after Swann’s first coordinate experiments.</p>
<p id="filepos355237" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos347135">*</a> I mention this only because <a id="filepos355335"></a>sexual unorthodoxy seems unusually common (although certainly not universal) among people who come to be considered psychics. It is even mentioned in anthropological accounts of shamans and medicine men. The reasons may have to do with the genetics of the brain, and/or ordinary social psychology—perhaps being unorthodox in one way encourages a person to be unorthodox in other ways—but I don’t know of any good research that sheds light on the question.</p>
<p class="calibre_21"><a id="filepos355880"></a><a href="#filepos348156">†</a>These figures were later shown to be too high (though to Puthoff, still high enough), because the target set—like a deck of cards in which every card drawn alters the chances of drawing another—was not statistically independent.</p>

<a id="filepos356265"></a>A similar experiment, suggesting telepathic transfer between two out of fifteen tested pairs of identical twins, had been conducted by other U.S. researchers a few years previously.</p>
<p id="filepos356483" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos351562">*</a> “Secret writing” was a very common technique by which low-level foreign agents sent information to the spy agency employing them. The ability to find an envelope containing secret writing in a stack of ordinary mailroom envelopes would give an enormous counterintelligence advantage to whoever possessed it, for it would mean that enemy spies who communicated via secret writing could be tracked down relatively easily.</p>
