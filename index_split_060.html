Harary, citing security obligations, refused to discuss this with me when I first interviewed him in July 1994, but he later commented on it publicly during an appearance on <a></a><em class="calibre4">Larry King Live</em> on November 29, 1995. Lyons and Truzzi 1991, who briefly refer to the episode, report that there was some skepticism at the NSC over the usefulness of Harary’s data.</p>
