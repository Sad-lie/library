Growing up in Telluride, Colorado, he says, he had out-of-body experiences and premonitions, could see people’s auras, and in his reveries encountered various supernatural beings. He was left-handed, intuitive, artistic, emotionally sensitive, curious about the unusual, and bored by the usual. He was considered odd, and had few friends at school. “I was doubly, triply, <em class="calibre4">quadruply</em> freaky,” he would later remember, with bitter pride.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After college, he joined the Army, and served in Korea and later at a Nike missile base outside Boston. A photograph taken of him in Seoul in the mid-1950s shows a dapper, even rakish Radar O’Reilly, with a camouflage-patterned cravat enhancing his olive-drab uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When he left the Army, Swann—“Douglas Swan”—moved <a id="filepos224647"></a>to New York City, to Greenwich Village, determined to become an artist. Nothing much sold, so he worked for the UN for a number of years, painting in his spare time, and then wrote pulp fiction for a while. By 1971 he was using his first name, Ingo, had added the second <em class="calibre4">n</em> to his surname on the advice of a numerologist, and had discovered that he seemed to have unusual psychic talents. He began earning his wages as a subject in parapsychology laboratories.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann arrived to begin his CIA contract at Stanford Research Institute a few days before Christmas 1972. He was a somewhat stout, soft-looking man, thirty-nine years old, with close-cropped brown hair and a broad Scandinavian face. Stepping off the plane in San Francisco, he wore a white jacket, white Levi’s, and a white cowboy hat. By now something of a bon vivant in New York, he was accompanied by a large number of suitcases and trunks, containing his substantial and varied wardrobe. He seldom felt comfortable anywhere outside of Manhattan, but he had decided to give California a try.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Unfortunately, things didn’t develop quite as Swann had expected, at least not at first. In experiment after experiment, his psi abilities seemed feeble. He became depressed, and had increasingly serious disagreements with Puthoff and his newly hired assistant, Russell Targ.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of Swann’s complaints had to do with Targ’s <a id="filepos226286"></a>ESP teaching machine. A special project Targ had brought with him to SRI, it was essentially a primitive computer that controlled the lightbulbs behind four small photographic slides of artworks. For each round, the computer would randomly illuminate one of the slides, and the subject had to try to guess which one beforehand. The results of each trial were automatically displayed, to give the subject feedback, and were automatically recorded, to prevent fraud. Targ called it an ESP “teaching” machine because, he argued, <a></a>the feedback taught the subject, at some subconscious level, to do better next time.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann tried it out for a while, but he didn’t do spectacularly well at it, and on the whole he disliked the little machine. To him the thing was a depressing remnant of old-time parapsychology, when psychics had been made to guess abstract symbols on cards again and again until they fled from boredom. The more he was pressured by Targ to work with the machine, the more he resented Targ.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Targ, like Puthoff, was a laser physicist. Until recently he had worked at the research laboratories of the Sylvania Corporation, which manufactured televisions and lightbulbs, among other things. The ivory tower atmosphere of SRI seemed to suit him better, for Targ was the very picture of the intense scientist, the thinker disengaged from prosaic reality. He had this amazing, frizzy and wavy mass of red-brown hair, and his deep, monotonal voice conveyed a sense of authority, of dispassionate gnosis. To complete the picture, he would squint down at you, from his height of six feet five, through extraordinarily thick, eye-magnifying glasses, goggles that seemed to protect him from the absurdities of the ordinary world. His sister had married the chess master Bobby Fischer, and it was easy to imagine, when you looked at Targ, that some of Fischer’s neurotic cerebrality had somehow rubbed off on him. Another thing about Targ was that he had apparently been having spontaneous psychic experiences ever since he had been a child.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In any case, Swann had <a id="filepos228609"></a>other experiments to contend with besides Targ’s ESP machine. He was asked to guess, for example, whether a green argon laser in an adjacent room was turned on or off, and which of two identical canisters contained a promethium-147 radioactive source. Puthoff was trying to spice up the usual ESP routine, and he also knew that the psychic detection of, for example, radioactive material, would catch the eyes of intelligence officials. <a id="filepos229061"></a>Swann, who was trying to set up some psychic surveying work for petroleum companies, also arranged for experiments involving canisters filled with either water or oil.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But if Swann’s results in these experiments occasionally poked up through the threshold of chance and random noise, they didn’t set anyone’s pulse racing. And when Swann went against a small SRI magnetometer, in order to replicate his apparent feat at Varian Hall, nothing happened at all. The SRI program was shaping up to be another dusty parapsychological dead end.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Ultimately, Swann knew, the CIA wanted to use psychics for long-distance spying. But in discussions with Puthoff and Targ, he had recognized a subtle problem with this. If someone said to him, “Ingo, please give me your psychic impressions of Ramenskoye Airfield, near Moscow,” then whatever psychic impressions he might have of the airfield would probably be overwhelmed by his imagination—which would find it all too easy to conjure up scenes of massive runways and hangars. What he needed was a way to be directed to a target, precisely and economically, without actually being told what the target <em class="calibre4">was</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">According to Swann the answer came to him one evening in April 1973, as he lounged in a swimming pool, drinking scotch, at his apartment complex in nearby Mountain View. A voice in his head said, “Try coordinates.” As in geographical coordinates. In other words, Puthoff and Targ, instead of telling him the target, could simply give him the target’s precise latitude and longitude.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann arrived at the office the next morning and announced his proposal. Puthoff and Targ responded with thumbs down. As far as they were concerned, the idea of using geographical coordinates didn’t even begin to make sense. In the first place, they pointed out, if they were to give Swann a set of coordinates and he ended up correctly describing what was there, it might only mean that he had <a id="filepos231356"></a>seen the right map once, and had remembered everything on it, consciously or not. Psychologists called such a feat “eidetic” or “photographic” memory, or “cryptomnesia.” Therefore no skeptic was ever going to believe Swann was using psi, regardless of whether coordinates seemed to work. Even the parapsychologists might not believe it. After all, coordinate systems were arbitrary human creations. There was no reason to suppose that they would lead someone’s psi perception to a remote target. And if they did, they shouldn’t work any better than telephone numbers or street addresses. The whole idea was just absurd.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But Swann persisted, and raised his voice, and threatened to leave SRI. His threats weren’t necessarily idle. By this time he had already departed four or five times for short periods, sometimes to pursue other projects, but other times just to signal his annoyance at the way things were going.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ finally relented, agreeing to try Swann’s coordinate clairvoyance scheme, unofficially and temporarily, during their late-afternoon coffee breaks. The experiment, they decided, would run for two workweeks, and each afternoon they would give Swann ten pairs of coordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">To obtain the coordinates, they would simply consult a large world map that hung on the wall of a nearby lab. They would then bring the coordinates to Swann, who would have one or two minutes to describe what was at each coordinate-pair. Afterwards his descriptions would be compared with what was actually shown on the map. If after two weeks there was no sign of success, then the experiment would be over.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The first run of ten targets was on April 23, and took only fifteen minutes, from 5:10 to 5:25 <span><span class="calibre13">P.M</span></span>. Puthoff and Targ started out by giving Swann the coordinate-pair of 30 degrees north latitude, 90 degrees west longitude, which indicated a point in the eastern suburbs of New Orleans. <a id="filepos233657"></a>Swann’s description read in part: “Offshore … Island to west … Tropical.” When informed of the actual target and, again, the coordinates, he complained: “Thought you said 9 degrees”—which would have made his description even less accurate, since 30° north, 9° west lies in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, about 100 miles south-southwest of Marrakesh.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The second target was at 75° north, 45° west, which virtually anyone who had ever studied a world map would know was well within the Arctic Circle, somewhere around Greenland. Swann saw: “Ice.” It went on like this for eight more coordinate-pairs, descriptions that were obviously wrong alternating with descriptions that were trivially correct. After five days and fifty coordinate-pairs, Swann’s output remained more or less the same.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff and Targ were fairly sure that the experiment was headed for failure, and they communicated their lack of enthusiasm in various ways. One day Targ brought a phone into the testing room, in order to take calls if necessary. He didn’t think he should be tied down incommunicado by Swann, even for twenty minutes. Swann walked in and saw this phone, this auditory bomb, waiting to detonate inside his central nervous system as soon as he began to concentrate on a target. When Targ declined to remove it, Swann in frustration reached down, grasped the phone, ripped it out of its jack on the wall, and hurled it, cord flailing, into the corridor.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Starting in the second week of the coffee break tests, Swann’s responses seemed to increase in both accuracy and detail. When he was given the coordinates 41.5° north, 122° west, which described a place just east of California’s Mount Shasta, he said: “Definitely see mountain to southwest, not far, also to east. Must also be a big valley.” And the coordinates 64° north, 19° west, which described a point about 20 miles east of the volcano Mount Hekla in <a id="filepos235980"></a>southern Iceland, prompted him to respond: “Volcano to southwest. I think I’m over ocean.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">When Puthoff gave him the coordinates 2° south, 34° east—which Puthoff thought described the middle of Lake Victoria in Africa—Swann responded with: “Sense of speeding over water, landing on land. Lake to west, high elevation.” It looked like a near miss, but Swann insisted he had been right on target, and persuaded Puthoff to go out to a bookstore and buy a proper atlas. The <em class="calibre4">Times Atlas of the World</em> showed that 2° south, 34° east marked a spot <em class="calibre4">not</em> in the middle of Lake Victoria, as Puthoff had supposed, but near the Tanzanian village of Ushashi, some thirty miles inland from Victoria’s southeastern shore. Swann had indeed been right.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By the time ten days and one hundred coordinates had passed, Puthoff and Targ still found it hard to believe that Swann was actually using psi to obtain information on the places defined by the coordinates. But they did agree to further study, and they also tightened up the protocol. They arranged for their SRI division chief’s secretary, Judy Schmickley, to select coordinates from maps. She would then hand the coordinates, without any accompanying description, to Puthoff and Targ, who would sit with Swann while he went into psychic mode. In this way Puthoff and Targ wouldn’t know in advance what was at the coordinates, and thus couldn’t inadvertently cue Swann to the right answer.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">One day, <a id="filepos237759"></a>May 29 to be precise, Puthoff was sufficiently impressed with the coordinate experiments that he placed a call to CIA headquarters, to the office of Richard Kennett.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett was in his early thirties, with a wife and two young sons, and a house in the Virginia suburbs. He looked somewhat like the tennis player Jimmy Connors, though he and Connors didn’t have much else in common. Within a <a id="filepos238237"></a>decade, Kennett would be the assistant national intelligence officer<a id="filepos238313" href="#filepos257849">*</a> for chemical and biological warfare issues.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Here in the spring of 1973, Kennett was still only a few years into his CIA career, and served as an analyst in the Agency’s Office of Scientific Intelligence. He had a Ph.D. in neurophysiology, was soon to complete his M.D., and spent much of his time preparing top-secret evaluations of the health of various foreign heads of state.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett was a man of eclectic interests. The free world’s greatest spy organization often attracted his type. Ordinary science, like ordinary life, all too often left him bored; he seemed more at home confronting the wild extremes of human behavior. Religion and mysticism in particular fascinated him. Appropriately, then, he spent some of his CIA time monitoring the fringes of medicine and psychology, watching trends, attending conferences, visiting laboratories, looking for things that, though unconventional, might be useful to one side or another in the great game of the Cold War.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One of the areas he kept an eye on was parapsychology, in particular the goings-on at SRI. Although the contract with SRI was being run by a different office from Kennett’s,<a id="filepos239745" href="#filepos258098"><sup class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">†</span></sup></a> the Agency had wanted him to make an independent evaluation of the work being done there, as part of an <a></a>overall assessment of the importance of parapsychological research in the United States and the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, little of the work at SRI had interested him so far, but now Hal Puthoff was phoning him with news of a possible breakthrough: Ingo Swann’s coordinate-based clairvoyance scheme.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett was open-minded about the phenomena of psi. He wanted to see Puthoff perform rigorous scientific experiments, and let the chips fall where they may. But the CIA analyst scoffed at the idea of coordinates, for the same reasons that Puthoff had first been dubious.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“All right,” said Puthoff. “Why don’t you give me the coordinates of a place that I don’t know anything about?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Okay,” said Kennett, “But I’ll do you one better. I’ll get you the coordinates of some place that even I don’t know about.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett put the phone down and walked out of his office into the hallway. He had passed seven or eight doorways when he ran into a colleague named Bill O’Donnell. “Bill, I want some coordinates of something that’s on the East Coast,” he told him. “Some place where, if I show you a drawing or a photograph later, you’ll be able to say, ‘Yes, that’s what’s at those coordinates.’ ” “Sure,” said O’Donnell. “Give me a little while.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A few hours later, towards the end of the day, O’Donnell walked into Kennett’s office with a pair of coordinates written on a small slip of paper. They were precise coordinates, written down to minutes and seconds of latitude and longitude. Had Kennett checked a map, he would have seen that they described a location somewhere in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a few hours west of Washington. Just what was there, only O’Donnell knew.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett thanked O’Donnell, picked up the phone, and called Hal Puthoff at SRI.</p>
<p class="calibre_25"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_2"><a></a>A short time later, Swann sat at one end of a table in a conference room at SRI—smoking a cigar, as was his habit for most of his waking hours. Puthoff, sitting at the other end, read him the coordinates. The psychic wrote them down, and then, alternately closing his eyes, staring at the walls, and staring down at his writing paper, he began to sketch and to verbalize his impressions. The impressions seemed to arrive in brief, wavelike bursts of images and other sensory data: “This seems to be some sort of mounds or rolling hills … There is a city to the north; I can see taller buildings and some smog … This seems to be a strange place, somewhat like the lawns that one would find around a military base, but I get the impression that there are either some old bunkers around, or maybe this is a covered reservoir … There must be a flagpole, some highways to the west, possibly a river over to the far east, to the south more city.” He drew a map showing a circular target surrounded by a road to the south, a road to the west, and a river to the east. To the north was a town. The session had taken six minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The next morning, at his apartment in Mountain View, Swann had the impulse to do the site again. He worked on it between seven-thirty and eight, and brought in the following report to Puthoff:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Cliffs to the east, fence to the north. There’s a circular building (a tower?), buildings to the south. Is this a former Nike base or something like that? This is about as far as I could go without feedback, and perhaps guidance as to what was wanted. There is something strange about this area, but since I don’t know particularly what to look for within the scope of the cloudy ability, it is extremely difficult to make decisions on what is there and what is not. Imagination seems to get in the way. (For example, I seem to get the impression of something underground, but I’m not sure.) However, it is apparent <a id="filepos244755"></a>that on first sighting the general location was correctly spotted.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">Swann also had another more detailed map for Puthoff, depicting a broad, open space in a forested area. Lined by fences and a circular driveway, it contained a tall, flagpole-like object, and something large and circular. That was as far as Swann could go.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff didn’t know how well the psychic had done, but he put Swann’s report together and prepared to send it to Kennett. Before he could, Fate twisted, and a man named Patrick Price telephoned him.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price was a graying, semi-retired, somewhat grizzled-looking fellow in his fifties who lived up at Lake Tahoe. He had a small building-contractor business, and also raised Christmas trees to sell in the Bay Area. He had met Puthoff at a lecture in Los Angeles a few years before, and Puthoff and Swann had run into him more recently, in late 1972, as he was selling Christmas trees from a lot in Mountain View.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Price considered himself a psychic. Back in the 1950s, for example, he had been a local councilman in Burbank, a suburb of L.A., and had briefly served as the town’s police commissioner. Some difficult cases had arisen, and he believed he had developed important leads on them, thanks to information that had seemed to come to him spontaneously. At times, he claimed, he would even sit in the police dispatcher’s office, trying to get psychic impressions of the places where criminals were hiding. By now, he said, he had psychic impressions about people and distant events almost every day.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“On impulse,” Puthoff would say later, he decided to give Price the coordinates Richard Kennett had phoned in. It wasn’t a very secure or scientific way of going about things, but Kennett hadn’t said the coordinates were classifled, <a></a>and anyway there didn’t seem to be much to lose. Price said he would give it a try.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">That, according to Puthoff, was on the afternoon of the first of June. On the fourth, he received in the mail from Price an envelope, postmarked the second. It contained several pages of verbal descriptions and sketches. In those pages, Price had described more or less the same place that Swann had, but in much more detail, starting from high above the target and then moving down and around and within it.</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Looked at general area from altitude of about 1500′ above highest terrain. On my left forward quadrant is a peak in a chain of mountains, elevation approximately 4996′ above sea level. Slopes are greyish slate covered with variety of broad leaf trees, vines, shrubbery, and undergrowth. I am facing about 3°-5° west of north. Looking down the mountain to the right (east) side is a roadway, freeway country style—curves around base of mountain from S.W.—swings north for a few miles, then heads E.N.E. to a fairly large city about 30–40 miles distant. This area was a battleground in civil war—low rolling hills, creeks, few lakes or reservoirs. There is a smaller town a little S.E.… Weather at this time is cloudy, rainy. Temperature at my altitude about 54°—high cumulo-nimbus clouds to about 25,000–30,000′. Clear area, but turbulent, between that level and some cirro-stratus at 46,000′. Air mass in that strip moving W.N.W. to S.E.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre_27"><p class="calibre_14">Perceived that peak area has large underground storage areas. Road comes up back side of mountains (west slopes), fairly well concealed, deliberately so. It’s cut under trees where possible. Would be very hard to detect flying over area. Looks like former missile site—bases for launchers still there, but area now houses record storage area, microfilm, file cabinets; as you go into underground <a></a>area through aluminum rolled-up doors, first areas filled with records, etc. Rooms about 100′ long, 4′ wide, 20′ ceilings with concrete supporting pilasters, flare-shaped. Temperature cool—fluorescent lighted. Personnel, Army 5th Corps engineers. M/Sgt Long on desk placard on grey steel desk—file cabinets security locked—combination locks, steel rods through eye bolts. Beyond these rooms, heading east, are several bays with computers, communications equipment, large maps, display type, overlays. Personnel, Army Signal Corps. Elevators.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff looked at all this and immediately telephoned Price. He asked him to try to pick up more detailed information from within the site, especially any secret codewords, if possible. The SRI physicist sensed that Price was dead on target, and he wanted to gather enough information to impress the CIA beyond a shadow of a doubt. A few days later, Price responded with some impressions from one of the underground offices he had psychically entered:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">

</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff sent it all in to Richard Kennett, who looked at the material, then handed it to Bill O’Donnell, the fellow CIA officer who had provided the coordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“Rick, this isn’t even close,” said O’Donnell apologetically, once he had read the descriptions. “I gave you the coordinates of my summer cabin. I just took the maps out of my car, found out where my cabin was in the woods, and that’s what I gave you. This”—he said, pointing to the descriptions by Swann and Price—“is bullshit.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett was embarrassed, but he found it intriguing that both Swann and Price had described what seemed to be the same site. Was there something like that out in the Blue Ridge Mountains, near his friend’s cabin?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The next weekend he took his wife and children for a drive into the countryside. A few miles from his friend’s cabin he found a dirt road, a government No Trespassing sign, and some satellite antennas in the background. It was obviously some kind of secret military installation, and it seemed to match many of the SRI psychics’ descriptions. It was as if Swann and Price, instead of focussing on the cabin in the woods, had simply found this place more interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Monday morning, back at work, Kennett looked up an official who he thought might know about the strange military base out in West Virginia. He gave him the SRI psychics’ descriptions. The official said he would check the information out.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Within a short time, a day or two, Richard Kennett found himself at the center of an intense and very hostile <a></a>security investigation. Ingo Swann, and to a far greater extent Pat Price, had described details of a secret Pentagon facility in the hills near the West Virginia village of Sugar Grove. Ostensibly a U.S. Navy communications base, the site was manned by numerous military and civilian National Security Agency cryptographers, and it included large subterranean facilities tucked into the base of Reddish Knob Mountain, elevation 4,397 feet. Among its secret functions were the interception of international telephone communications, and the control of U.S. spy satellites. Much of it was underground, and nuclear-hardened, because it would be one of the first targets the Soviets hit if war broke out. Swann’s and Price’s remote-viewing data had been accurate enough to conjure up images, in Pentagon minds, of a massive and criminal leakage of top-secret, codeword-clearance information.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">“How did you get inside?” they asked Kennett, now made to feel like some Soviet mole. “What the hell were you doing there?”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Kennett explained as best he could, but the Pentagon security officials didn’t seem interested in stories about psychics. Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ were interrogated too, and soon learned that agents from the Defense Investigative Service were knocking on doors around their respective homes, asking neighbors whether Mr. Puthoff or Mr. Targ had ever been a Communist, or was spending too much money, or was otherwise behaving like a Soviet agent.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Failing to establish that anyone at SRI or Kennett’s office had deliberately stolen or leaked classified information, the Pentagon investigators eventually left them alone. A few years later, the National Security Agency, which ran the Sugar Grove site, would itself become involved in tasking remote-viewers at SRI and Fort Meade.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In the meantime, in that summer of 1973, Pat Price extended the olive branch to NSA, the CIA, and Richard <a></a>Kennett, as only he could. He did some more clairvoyant snooping, and came up with a detailed description of a Soviet installation that performed functions similar to the NSA site’s. Price pinpointed it at Mount Narodnaya in the remote northern Ural Mountains:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Area site underground, reinforced concrete, doorways of steel of the roll-up type … I see some helipads, concrete. Light rail tracks run from pads to another set of rails that parallel the doors into the mountain. 30 miles north (5° west of north) of the site is a radar installation with 1 large (165′) dish and two small fast-track dishes.</p></blockquote>
