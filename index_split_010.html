<p class="calibre_2"><span><span class="calibre12"><span class="bold1">M</span></span></span><span><span class="calibre13">EL</span></span> R<span><span class="calibre13">ILEY GREW UP IN THE CITY OF</span></span> R<span><span class="calibre13">ACINE</span></span>, W<span><span class="calibre13">ISCONSIN, JUST</span></span> below Milwaukee on the western shore of Lake Michigan. He was the second of five children, three boys and two girls; his father was a machine repairman who worked for Borden, the dairy company, and his mother was a homemaker. Mel ran with the local pack of youngsters, but he also had a shy and solitary streak and a special love of the outdoors. As a teenager he would go out into the deep woods in late autumn, with a friend or two, camping out in the snow, hunting deer, and occasionally running into bears. In the summer there was canoeing and fishing. And sometimes even in downtown Racine, in a bar or a dance hall on a Saturday night, the spirit would move him and he would drive, alone or with his date, out to one of the cliffs on the <a></a>east edge of town, staying up to watch the sun rise up over Lake Michigan.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The mind of any young person can be a jumble of altered states, but Mel at times seemed more altered than most. There was often about him a certain mild spaciness, a proneness to the zone. One summer day in preadolescence he was in an empty field near the lake, in a place where he was always finding arrowheads and other Native American artifacts. At some point a strange calm came upon him, and he smelled woodsmoke. He turned his head and saw an Indian village, with tepees, dogs, men and women, smoking meat, running children. Most of the village seemed oblivious of his presence, but some of the dogs barked, and one particularly tall and dignified Indian looked at him and seemed to wave. Then after a few more blinks of his eyes <a id="filepos26381"></a>Riley’s second sight grew dim, the warp in time was smoothed, and the village faded back into the field.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Riley was twenty-three years old, working in Racine as a machine repairman like his father, when he learned that he had been drafted by the Army. The date was July 7, 1969, two weeks before men would walk on the moon. Riley would later wonder if the journey he began that day had taken him farther.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At boot camp in Kentucky, there was a recruiter from Army intelligence, offering a special deal. If a draftee enlisted for three years instead of the usual two, he would be trained as a photo-interpreter. Riley signed up, and was sent to photo-interpreter school at Fort Holabird, in northern Maryland. From there he was sent to Germany, to the 7405th Operations Squadron, a special Army/Air Force unit at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Wiesbaden. The unit’s job was to fly covert reconnaissance missions through East Germany, zig-zagging along accepted air traffic corridors—usually between Wiesbaden and Berlin—in planes disguised as ordinary cargo planes. Looking down and side- <a></a>ways across miles of East German terrain, they would spy on armored divisions, airfields, radar sites, and whatever else they could reach with their special cameras and electronic-intercept gear.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Satellites would normally have been able to do the job more safely, but Eastern Europe was often blanketed by clouds, and in any case, Soviet bloc military officials generally knew when U.S. satellites were passing overhead. The aircraft Riley’s unit flew could go in under the clouds, and weren’t always recognizable as spy planes until they were practically on top of their targets—when doors would suddenly open all over the airframe, and camera lenses and radio and microwave antennas and infrared detector pods would start poking out. There was a panic button the crew could hit, in case an East German military jet decided to check them out, and then all the lenses and antennas and pods would pop back inside the airframe, like a turtle’s limbs into its shell, and all the doors would close, and the plane would revert to its innocent, cargo-carrying state.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley’s task, when he wasn’t at his light-table in Wiesbaden scanning the photographic results of these missions, was to serve as an aerial observer on some of the missions themselves, peering out the aircraft window with binoculars and telling his colleagues where to aim their intelligence-gathering equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos29283"></a>Riley did well at this job, and earned a number of medals. He also developed a reputation as a fellow with a sixth sense. As an aerial observer, he seemed to have an unusually accurate intuition about where to head the plane or point the cameras. And as a photo analyst, he seemed able to see things in a reconnaissance image that no one else could see. One of his commendations came after he had analyzed a photo of an East German industrial area and found what seemed to be a new Soviet artillery piece, sitting on a flatcar in a rail yard. The artillery piece, which hadn’t yet been seen in that particular area and was there-fore <a></a>significant to Army intelligence, was actually hidden by a canvas canopy. But Riley somehow had a feeling about what it was, and sketched it anyway. Satellite photographs later confirmed the sketch.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley was kept on in Wiesbaden for two three-year tours. Then, in 1976, he received word that he’d been ordered to a new posting, at Fort Meade, with something called the Operations Security Group. Operations security—“opsec” for short—simply meant the protection of sensitive operations from foreign espionage. Riley’s new unit was a kind of Red-Team, its task being literally to spy on certain U.S. military facilities in an effort to find and correct security lapses. Riley’s specific job was to analyze photographic intelligence on these installations—from satellites, aircraft, and even hand-held cameras at close range. One of his most memorable targets was the Army’s experimental XM-1 tank (now the M-1), then undergoing gunnery trials at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, at the north end of Chesapeake Bay. Riley’s team arranged to take into the Chesapeake near Aberdeen a U.S. Coast Guard boat outfitted with long-range cameras and other spy gear, to see if they could gather meaningful intelligence on the XM-1 trials. As they were sailing along, all systems go, a Russian freighter suddenly appeared and cruised past them in the shipping lanes, its own spy-cameras and antennas tactfully hidden.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Down the hall from Riley’s office in building 4554 at Fort Meade was something called the <a id="filepos31651"></a>Systems Exploitation Team, or “SET.” It had been set up by the head of the Army Intelligence Agency, Brigadier General Edmund Thompson, and was meant to be a small, multidisciplinary group of creative, lateral thinkers, tackling the strangest and toughest military intelligence problems. They considered themselves an elite bunch.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day, early in 1977, Riley was chatting with a friend at SET, a fellow sergeant named Bill Young. Riley noticed that Young had some unusual books on his shelf, books <a></a>about “psi” phenomena such as extrasensory perception, psychokinesis, and out-of-body experiences. Young explained that the Soviets, and some of the Eastern European countries, were trying to use psi for military purposes—employing psychics, for example, to spy on intelligence targets in the United States. A Colonel Kowalski at SET was studying the situation, so far just informally. But who knew where it would lead? Maybe one day the United States would be employing its own psychic spies.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley’s ears pricked up. Psychic spies? Would the Army ever undertake a project <em class="calibre4">that</em> bizarre? If it did, he certainly wanted to be involved.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Fresh from officer candidate training and espionage school at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Skip <a id="filepos33158"></a>Atwater arrived at Fort Meade in the summer of 1977. It was a time of great upheaval and acronymic confusion in the Army intelligence bureaucracy. The U.S. Army Intelligence Agency (USAINTA) was merging with the <a id="filepos33378"></a>Army Security Agency (ASA) to form the all-in-one Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).<a id="filepos33479" href="#filepos70807">*</a> Atwater was assigned to one of the opsec teams, which now became part of SET, which in turn became SED—the Systems Exploitation <em class="calibre4">Detachment</em>—and was attached not to INSCOM but to the office of the assistant chief of staff for intelligence, the ACSI. The ACSI was now the former USAINTA commander, Edmund Thompson, who was now a major general.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">By coincidence, Atwater ended up with the desk and the safe of SET’s Colonel Kowalski, who had since moved <a></a>somewhere else. It was a nice coincidence, because Atwater, like Kowalski, had a strong interest in psi. Atwater spent hours going through the psi-related documents Kowalski had left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater—born Frederick Holmes Atwater, but nicknamed Skip—had grown up in Glendale, California, in a house on the edge of town with some land around it, plus dogs, cats, and even a goat and a donkey. His father was a dentist. His mother, a homemaker, had a strong belief in things paranormal and supernatural, and Atwater was similarly inclined. For a time in his teenage years, he seemed to be able to travel “out of body” almost at will, sometimes using his weird ability to float from his bed, through the walls of his house, across town, and into the bedroom of whatever high school girl he had chosen for that night (alas, like a ghost he could only gawk). Researchers might debate whether such experiences represented actual “astral travel,” or ESP in the form of moving images, or merely vivid, fantasy-driven dreams, but to Atwater they were real enough.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Early in his military career, Atwater heard about Soviet and Eastern European psi research; he also heard rumors that the CIA had been responding with its own psi research, some of which had been wildly successful. For someone who had long been intrigued by the possibilities of the paranormal, it all sounded too good to be true. Mainstream scientists tended to reject psi research, calling it “pseudoscience,” a morass of fraud and delusion. And yet the stories Atwater heard suggested that the U.S. and Soviet governments had simply decided to bypass mainstream science, embarking on nothing less than a paranormal arms race. And it was all a secret.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater learned more after he arrived at Fort Meade. He learned that the CIA’s psi research had been conducted since 1972, at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), a big scientific thinktank in Menlo Park, California. He learned that <a></a>SRI researchers, after experimenting with various psi phenomena, had decided to concentrate on clairvoyance—the psychic “seeing” of things otherwise hidden by obstacles or distance—for use in espionage. The SRI researchers, in rivalry with their Soviet counterparts, were attempting nothing less than the development of the perfect spies, human beings who, undetectably and at almost zero cost, could spy upon the most remote, sensitive, and heavily guarded locations. Throwing out the old labels for psychic phenomena, the SRI scientists were calling their clairvoyant techniques “remote viewing.”<a id="filepos36955" href="#filepos71323">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_14">At Fort Meade, Atwater began to argue that remote viewing represented a potential security threat, and should be studied in that light by the Army’s opsec teams. He proposed to the head of SED, a Colonel Robert Keenan, that a small remote-viewing team be assembled. Its members, he suggested, could be screened for psychic abilities from the local population of Army intelligence personnel. Those selected for psychic duty wouldn’t even have to leave their old units. They could come in to Fort Meade to do remote viewing a few hours a week, against targets chosen by the Opsec Group. They would be just another group of specialists working part-time for the opsec units, just like specialists in electronic intercepts and spy satellite photography. They would have a low profile and would cost the Army almost nothing. But they would enable the Army to determine how serious the Soviet remote-viewing threat might be. If it turned out that remote viewers didn’t pose a serious threat to U.S. security, then so much the better.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos38200"></a>Atwater’s proposal went up the chain of command and was approved, remarkably, without any significant controversy. The proposal was eventually seen by the nominal overseer of SED, the Army’s assistant chief of staff for intelligence, <a></a>Major General Thompson. Strange as it might have seemed, <a id="filepos38521"></a>Thompson had considerable enthusiasm for the idea of psychic spying. He had been nurturing his own interest in psi, ever since reading Arthur Koestler’s pro-paranormal book <em class="calibre4">The Roots of Coincidence</em> a few years earlier. Thompson also had heard about the remote-viewing work going on out at SRI, under the CIA’s sponsorship. He liked the idea of getting the Army involved in remote viewing, but without having to rely too much on the CIA or SRI. He liked the idea of his own, secret unit of experimental psychic spies.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater’s project was initially given the code name <a id="filepos39200"></a>Gondola Wish. As Atwater had suggested, it consumed minimal resources. <a id="filepos39279"></a>Atwater was given a few thousand dollars in travel money, some cramped office space in building 4554 at Fort Meade—for which he had to scrounge carpets and furniture—and a commanding officer, Major Watt, whose volcanic temper was said to have left a cloud over his career. Some years before, while stationed in Panama, he had struck a fellow officer who had insulted his wife. Watt was never convicted of any offense, and in general he seemed an honorable and conscientious military officer, but since the incident, he felt, he hadn’t been promoted as rapidly as he deserved. Atwater was told that Watt had been chosen for this assignment—obscure, and perhaps only temporary, but with the potential for enormous controversy—only because it was felt that he had so little to lose.<a id="filepos40101" href="#filepos71496">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre_23">Atwater’s and Watt’s <a id="filepos40258"></a>first task was to select about a dozen potential psychics from the local population of Army intelligence personnel. To get an idea of the kind of person who would make a good remote viewer, the two officers visited SRI and talked to researchers there. The SRI researchers were somewhat evangelical on the subject of remote viewing; <a></a>they believed that remote-viewing ability was like musical ability: everyone had it to some degree. To find those who had the most ability, the SRI researchers said, the best thing to do was simply to test relatively large groups of people against remote-viewing targets, and see how well they did.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The problem was, Atwater and Watt didn’t want it widely known that they were setting up a remote-viewing unit. They couldn’t travel around giving military officers ESP tests. They needed a stealthier way of finding good psychics.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos41293"></a>SRI researchers had already been wrestling with this problem for some time, running medical, neurological, and psychological profiles of their remote viewers, looking for attributes that stood out. So far, about all they had found was that artistic talent, visual-spatial intelligence, and creativity all tended to be associated with high remote-viewing scores. Also, SRI researchers believed that perceiving psi data with the mind’s eye was like glimpsing a scene only briefly in real life. People who were good at describing and detailing such glimpses should, they reasoned, be good remote viewers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But SRI researchers had to admit that even these attributes provided only a rough screening tool. As far as they were concerned, the best way to find good psychics, if one was limited to asking questions in interviews, was to ask the interviewees whether they had had any psychic experiences, or simply whether they believed in psi.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos42387"></a>Back in Washington, Atwater and Watt quietly contacted INSCOM unit commanders at Fort Meade, and also at IN-SCOM’s headquarters at Arlington Hall in northern Virginia, a military/civilian intelligence complex that had once been a private school for girls. The two officers asked the various INSCOM unit commanders to name people in their offices who fit the rough personality profile the SRI researchers had developed. Atwater and Watt also made the <a></a>rounds of Army offices at the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) in southeast Washington, believing that photo-interpreters, with their visual skills, would probably make excellent candidates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Generating a list of a few hundred candidates this way, Atwater and Watt then called the candidates in for personal interviews. The candidates were asked about their backgrounds, with particular emphasis on their paranormal beliefs and experiences. The candidates were told that it was just a general survey on psi that the INSCOM commander had ordered. But photo-interpreter Mel Riley, when he was called in, knew what the questions were really about. He had kept his ear to the ground, and realized he was being considered for Gondola Wish.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Following this first round of interviews, Atwater and Watt selected a few dozen of the most promising candidates, and then examined their personnel files. The two officers weren’t just interested in raw psi potential. They realized they also needed to have men and women with competence and intelligence, and a willingness to learn new things. They didn’t want an undisciplined group of crystal-ball gazers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After going through the files, they cut the list of candidates down to about twenty, and called all of them in for a second interview. Mel Riley, who had made the cut again, was now told that the Army was thinking about setting up a special team, a team of people who would be trained as psychic spies for use in opsec missions. Was he interested in being on the team?</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley didn’t hesitate. He was definitely interested. It was about the sexiest military program he had ever heard of.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Not long afterwards, in early 1978, Riley was ordered to an eavesdropping-proof “secure room” across from Colonel Keenan’s office in building 4554. When he arrived, he found himself with the other candidates—ten or eleven of <a></a>them—plus Atwater and Watt, who gave a short briefing on the program and its reasons for being.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The unit was only experimental, warned Watt and Atwater; it might not survive long. The candidates assembled in the room would serve only part-time, perhaps a few hours per week, or as needed, and would officially remain attached to their old units. However, there was obviously an interest in the remote-viewing project at high levels. Perhaps if things went well, the project would expand, and Gondola Wish would usher in a new era in military espionage.</p>
<p class="calibre_23"><a id="filepos45850"></a>The group Atwater and Watt selected had, as expected, a heavy emphasis on photo-interpreters. Riley was one. Another was a tall, solid-looking former Navy petty officer named Hartleigh Trent. Now in his fifties, the graybeard of Gondola Wish (most of the others were in their late twenties or early thirties), Trent had been Riley’s instructor for a course on overhead reconnaissance at Fort Holabird eight years before. He worked down at NPIC and also part-time for the opsec teams. Four other Army civilians in the group—Nancy Stern, Steve Hanson, Bud Duncan, and Steve Holloway<a id="filepos46452" href="#filepos71652">*</a>—were also photo-interpreters. Hanson was a devout Christian; when he started remote-viewing training, he would learn to “cool down” before a session by reading Bible verses.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">There was a tall Army captain, Janice Rand, who worked in one of the INSCOM offices at Fort Meade. And there were several officers and civilians from the operations side of Army espionage. One was a counterintelligence specialist, Captain Ken Bell. Short, wiry, somewhat intense, he was into meditation. Another counterintelligence man was Fernand <a id="filepos47119"></a>Gauvin, a dark-haired, handsome Rhode Islander, a civilian in his late forties. Gauvin had a long history of <a></a>psychic experiences and transcendental yearnings, going back to his childhood. Somewhere in his teens he had belonged to a Catholic lay order, the Brothers of the Sacred Heart; he still went to mass regularly, but his faith now had a New Age tinge. He practiced yoga and meditation, experimented with altered states, and read books about spirit-mediums and auras. In 1975, he had had an unusual out-of-body-type experience, an encounter with some kind of benevolent, luminous, loving entity that had blown his mind. He still talked about it.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Gauvin and Bell worked down at Arlington Hall, home to some of the more James Bond-ish elements of the U.S. espionage community. Jackie Keith, another Arlington Hall civilian selected for Gondola Wish, worked in special ops, and always seemed to be involved in half a dozen cloak-and-dagger schemes, all going at once. Finally there was Joe McMoneagle, a bull-necked warrant officer; he was in charge of a group of technicians down at Arlington Hall, and had worked on special radio-intercept teams everywhere from the Bahamas to Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">For McMoneagle, Riley, and the others, it seemed fortunate that they were attached to Gondola Wish only part-time at first, because the project began with <a id="filepos48637"></a>frustrating slowness, as if trying to avoid attention and controversy by doing as little as possible. There were no operations, only practice, and for a while there was not even practice.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The first remote-viewing session was undertaken by Mel Riley, lying on a couch in a makeshift remote-viewing room down the hall from the unit’s small office in building 4554. Atwater sat by as his monitor. There was no control room, and Atwater merely held a portable cassette recorder to take down Riley’s impressions. Scotty Watt, who himself was the target for the session, meanwhile walked over to a building a few hundred yards away, a guest house for visiting senior officers at Fort Meade.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The remote-viewing protocol in this case was one that <a></a>had been used for some of the experiments out at SRI, although it wasn’t well-suited for use against actual intelligence targets. Researchers at SRI called it “outbound remote viewing,” because an “outbound” experimenter (in this case, Watt) would go to a randomly selected site. The remote viewer would then try to describe the outbound experimenter’s surroundings, by freehand sketching and by verbalizing the impressions that drifted into consciousness. Riley could try to go into a relatively deep, trancelike state, lying down on the couch in total darkness, murmuring his impressions and then waking up and sketching them afterwards. Or he could sit up on the couch during the session, with the room light dimly on, sketching his impressions as they came to him. Atwater encouraged experimentation. His guiding principle was pure Californian: <em class="calibre4">hey, whatever works for you</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley sank down into what would become his preferred method, a mild eyes-closed trance in a darkened room, and described his impressions. He had glimpses of a manhole cover, a sidewalk, and a few other vaguely defined items. Afterwards he tried to sketch what he had seen. When Watt came back and took him to the target, Riley saw that he had identified some of its elements, but not very completely, and on the whole not very accurately. It wasn’t an auspicious start.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Before any further practice sessions could be conducted, <a id="filepos51157"></a>word came down from on high that remote viewing, somewhat belatedly, had been determined to be a form of “human use experimentation.” The dark history of such experimentation in the military—in particular, the controversial studies of LSD and other potential “<a id="filepos51453"></a>mind control” or “truth serum” drugs on servicemen in the 1950s and 1960s—meant that it now had to involve the informed consent of its participants, plus approval and oversight by the Army’s human use review board. Riley and the others filled out sheafs of informed consent paperwork, while various <a></a>medical officials were asked to sign off on the project. By the time the buck was passed all the way up to the Army’s surgeon general, and a restart of the program was authorized, a few months had elapsed.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">When the program resumed, the <a id="filepos52116"></a>six most promising members of the team—Riley, Joe McMoneagle, Ken Bell, Fern Gauvin, Nancy Stern, and Hartleigh Trent—were selected to travel to SRI’s campus in Menlo Park, California, to spend a couple of weeks as subjects in outbound remote-viewing experiments. They were told that they were going to SRI to learn the think tank’s special remote-viewing methods. But in fact, Atwater and Watt primarily wanted SRI to evaluate the talents of the six, secretly naming the <em class="calibre4">three</em> who would be most useful as operational remote viewers. In the end, SRI sent the viewers back with the comment that all six seemed good enough to use in operations.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The others who had not gone to SRI would eventually fade from the remote-viewing scene. Some had problems with Gondola Wish anyway; it required them to turn up several hours per week, during normal work hours, but because of the project’s secrecy they were generally not allowed to tell their ordinary bosses where they were really going. That was an impossible situation for some. Others had problems relaxing into the groove of remote viewing itself. Steve <a id="filepos53342"></a>Hanson, in the throes of the zone, was apt to yank himself out of it with worries over whether he was doing it just right. <em class="calibre4">No, wait, that’s not … Okay—No, wait …</em></p>
<p class="calibre_14">Mel Riley naturally was pleased that he had cleared this last hurdle, and as he began to spend an increasing amount of time at the remote-viewing unit, the quality of his experimental spying seemed to improve. One day he was asked to target Scotty Watt, and at the appointed time for the start of the session, he was in his zone, trying to tune in <a id="filepos53990"></a>to Watt, wherever he was … Well, it was strange. Riley tasted chocolate. Just as if he were chewing a chocolate bar. He also saw, on the flickering screen of his mind, a glass jar filled with coins. Then he sensed a road, and a group of cars. Ten or fifteen minutes after the session was over, Watt walked into the office and drove Riley and Atwater out to where he had just been standing. It was a Volkswagen dealership, along a highway a few miles from Fort Meade. Riley couldn’t figure out why he had tasted chocolate and had seen a jar of coins. Then Watt sheepishly admitted that he had arrived at the target a few minutes late; at the start of the session he had actually been at a 7-Eleven convenience store, where he had bought and eaten a chocolate bar. There on the counter next to the cash register had been one of those jars of coins for the March of Dimes.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">It eventually occurred to some in the unit that training targets might be made a bit more interesting. Atwater, for example, had the idea of trying to win the Maryland lottery. He called for volunteers from among the remote viewers, and set up some informal “associative remote viewing” (ARV) experiments, in which objects were substituted for numbers as targets. For reasons that weren’t entirely clear, numbers themselves were extremely difficult to remote-view directly. In ARV, a teddy bear might stand for 0, a baseball bat for 1, an orange for 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater would assign these objects to numbers secretly. Then he would ask the viewers to enter trances and see into the future, describing the objects that he, Atwater, would present them with on the following day—those objects corresponding to the winning lottery numbers, which by then would have been published. If the RVers reported seeing rows of objects that Atwater had secretly chosen and that neatly translated into a lottery number, he would then place his bets accordingly. The idea was that the remote viewers were simply precognizing their own futures, instead <a id="filepos56204"></a>of focusing on the lottery numbers themselves. Unfortunately, it never seemed to work.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater also came up with a treasure-hunt scheme. Some nineteenth-century American adventurer had made a fortune out west, and then had taken it all back east, in the form of jewels and currency. According to the story, he had buried it all somewhere in Virginia, leaving in his writings cryptic clues to the treasure site. Riley and McMoneagle joined the chase and, with remote viewing, tried to narrow the search. Eventually they took a field trip to the general area where the treasure seemed to be, and looked around, driving along country roads and walking through pastures, waiting for a psychic jolt that would lead them in the right direction. They never found the treasure, though in one field, Riley and McMoneagle found an angry bull, and Riley still carries in his memory today the surreal image of McMoneagle—short, stout, not a sprinter—clearing a five-foot barb-wire fence while running uphill.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Major General Thompson, the Army’s assistant chief of staff for intelligence, watched benignly over the unit during these first months, encouraged by its performance in practice sessions. And because those in Gondola Wish, and out at SRI, seemed to think that <em class="calibre4">anyone</em> could demonstrate some remote-viewing ability, the general eventually decided to give it a try himself.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Responding to the general’s summons one day, Scotty Watt arrived with Mel Riley, by now regarded as a good monitor as well as a remote viewer. Riley sat down in Thompson’s large Pentagon office, with the general and one of his staff officers, a Major Stone. Stone would be the outbound experimenter, the “beacon,” while Thompson tried to remote-view him. Stone and Thompson agreed on a start time for the session, and then Stone left for the target; only he knew what it would be. At the appointed time, Thompson told his secretary to hold his calls. He <a id="filepos58406"></a>prepared himself at his desk, with a small stack of blank white paper and a pen. Guided by Riley, he began to describe the images that came into his mind. He had a fleeting glimpse of a bulky, grand-looking building, and next to it a pool of water. He seemed to be looking down on it from a height. He guessed it was the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall near the Capitol; the memorial overlooks a shallow ornamental pool known as the Reflecting Pool.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A half hour or so later, Major Stone came back. It turned out that he had gone not to the Lincoln Memorial but to the Alexandria train station, several miles south of the Pentagon. It looked like a clear “miss,” yet when Thompson visited the site, he saw only a few hundred yards away another bulky, grand-looking building, known as the Masonic Temple. It was much more prominent than the train station; in fact it dominated the western skyline of the old colonial section of Alexandria, and it also had a large pool of water close by its western side. Thompson decided he had actually zeroed in on the Temple—and had mistaken it for the Lincoln Memorial. A few weeks later, Thompson was flying out of Washington on official business, and as his plane lifted off from National Airport, heading south over the Potomac, he looked out the window and saw the old section of Alexandria laid out before him. Suddenly—<em class="calibre4">déjà vu</em>—it all fell into place. He decided that what he was seeing, from this unusually elevated angle, was merely a clearer version of what he had glimpsed during the remote-viewing session.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Gondola Wish had support not only from General Thompson but also, at least tacitly, from INSCOM commander William Rolya, Army Chief of Staff Edward C. “Shy” Meyer, and Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander. Even so, the project’s budgetary insignificance resulted in a number of <a id="filepos60467"></a>practical annoyances for the remote viewers. Once in trance, for example, a remote viewer was apt to <a></a>become highly sensitive to any sounds around him. Thus he needed a quiet room, preferably a very quiet room. But the small room set aside for remote viewing in 4554 was directly beneath a ladies’ room. Riley and other remote viewers were constantly being flushed out of their zones by unwitting servicewomen on the floor above.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Worse, though, were the unexpected noises. One afternoon, Ken Bell was in the darkened viewing room, and Mel Riley was serving as his monitor. Bell liked to cool down by imagining a slowly spinning golden orb. All was quiet, and Bell was observing his orb, glowing and revolving, down in his zone, so deep, so quiet …</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><span><span class="calibre13">BOOOOM!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre_14">An earsplitting concussion shook the room; Bell was so shocked he seemed to levitate several feet off the couch before landing again and pulling his traumatized nervous system back together. It turned out that some general was retiring, and he was being saluted on the parade ground across the street with a battery of 155-millimeter howitzers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Eventually, after persistent complaints about such incidents, the unit was moved to buildings 2560 and 2561 on Llewellyn Street, a half mile away. They weren’t very attractive structures, and as it had been with the first suite of offices, much of the refurbishing had to be done by the remote viewers themselves. McMoneagle, something of an artist, put on the finishing touch by painting the deep-space mural on the old oven heat shield in 2561. But despite the makeshift, low-rent atmosphere of it all, the remote viewers quickly grew to like their new buildings; they were quiet, and there was much more space. There were three separate RV rooms in the “ops” building, 2560, plus a control room from which Scotty Watt, or visitors from tasking offices, could listen in and give instructions to the monitor as necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Late in 1978, around the time of the move to the new buildings, Gondola Wish underwent a transformation, <a id="filepos62948"></a>thanks to what a later <a id="filepos62979"></a>Army memo would call “preliminary results and high level interest.” The <a id="filepos63073"></a>high-level interest came from General Thompson and others at the Pentagon and CIA, some of whom, for the last few years, had been sending intelligence taskings to the remote viewers out at SRI. These officials had heard about the Fort Meade remote viewers, and had decided that they wanted to be able to send taskings to them, too. The idea seemed to be that by consulting two independent sets of psychics, three thousand miles apart, they could compare what the two produced and get a better idea of how accurate the data were likely to be. In the long run, it was thought, the SRI group would focus on the scientific end of things, while the Fort Meade remote viewers would concentrate on operations.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Starting in late 1978, then, the Fort Meade unit began to move away from its <a id="filepos63933"></a>originally envisioned function on the opsec teams. Although it would accept opsec-related targets, it would now be seen primarily as an offensive spying team, available for use by anyone in the intelligence community with the proper connections and clearances. To facilitate this role, General Thompson increased the unit’s effective budget, and gave it three slots for full-time remote viewers: Mel Riley, Ken Bell, and Joe McMoneagle. The unit now became known as “Special Action Branch.” Although it took its orders from General Thompson’s office, it was essentially a psychic spying unit that was available to all approved customers in the intelligence community.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Marking this transition, the code name Gondola Wish disappeared. In its place came “<a id="filepos64800"></a>Grill Flame,” a Pentagon code name that referred to the overall remote-viewing program, encompassing both the Fort Meade unit and the work at SRI.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">At its inception, Grill Flame was one of the most secret programs being run by the Pentagon. The <a id="filepos65131"></a>secrecy was designed not just to protect the program from Soviet eyes, but—perhaps more important—to protect its supporters <a id="filepos65277"></a>from the sheer mortification and embarrassment they would feel if the program were exposed. <em class="calibre4">Psychics in the Pentagon! The Army’s crystal ball gazers!</em> Such a story would surely break one day. Almost every secret in Washington surfaced eventually. General Thompson and the others running Grill Flame simply hoped that that day would be a long time coming.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Many dozens of operational taskings later, in the late summer of 1979, Mel Riley remote-viewed the Chinese nuclear device at Lop Nor. On that first morning of the operation, he spent an hour on the remote-viewing couch, drifting in and out of the zone, describing to Skip Atwater what he saw and felt. Afterwards he sketched some impressions that had come to him. One stood out; it was a shape that looked like a basketball with two large funnels sticking out of opposite ends. A double-ended loudspeaker. An hourglass on its side. A bow tie. Riley didn’t pretend to be a nuclear weapons engineer; he didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After Riley had finished, it was Joe McMoneagle’s turn, and he descended into his own quiet zone. <a id="filepos66542"></a>McMoneagle’s zone was so deep, he often began snoring during his cool-down period; when he reported back during the session, it was usually in sleepy, apneic murmurs, as if he were talking to someone in a dream. McMoneagle ended up drawing a detailed diagram of the device, including, at its center, the same hourglass-shaped object Riley had described. Ken Bell described the device too.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Atwater wrote a cover summary of the sessions and handed them over to the Air Force officials who had tasked the operation. They seemed to show great interest in the sketches of the hourglass-shaped device. “What is it?” Atwater wanted to know. “We can’t tell you,” replied one of the Air Force officials. “You don’t have a CNWDI clearance.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">CNWDI—“cinwiddie”—stood for Critical Nuclear <a></a>Weapons Design Information. The hourglass-shaped device, it turned out, was a design element the Chinese hadn’t been thought capable of incorporating into their bombs.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Mel Riley and the other remote viewers were usually judged to have no “need to know” how well they had done, and consequently seldom did know. Only occasionally, they would be officially briefed, or Watt or Atwater would give them a pat on the back. If their target had been part of some major crisis, they might even get their feedback through the newspapers.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On this day, Riley knew at least that he couldn’t be far off, for he was called back into the RV room in the afternoon, for another round. When he had drifted down to his zone, Atwater asked him to describe an “event” and gave him a set of geographical coordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley now sensed a broad, bleak desert, and a series of wide concentric rings, miles in diameter, circling a central point marked by a tower or some other object. He sensed an airplane, a bomb being dropped, then … nothing. He wasn’t sure what had happened. Later Joe McMoneagle took a turn. He described “a hell of an explosion,” but sensed that the explosion had been a failure; it had not gone nuclear.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Riley would never know the full story behind that target, only that Atwater and Watt had seemed pleased afterward. But in fact, the remote-viewing operation had gone very well. The descriptions of the nuclear device, though hard to confirm, had elements that obviously made sense to U.S. weapons analysts, and at least suggested a starting point for analysis and further collection. The description of the failed test also made sense. The tasking had originated because U.S. intelligence had failed to detect a nuclear explosion at the Lop Nor test site on the day the test was expected. American spy satellites, U-2 reconnaissance planes rigged to gather airborne radioactive dust, and other collections systems all had come up empty. But the remote viewers’ <a></a>data had suggested a straightforward reason for the absence of a nuclear explosion: the bomb had exploded but had failed to go nuclear.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">American officials eventually used other sources of intelligence to confirm what the remote viewers had detected. A plane carrying the new Chinese device had flown high over the testing site, ready to drop the bomb for an airburst over ground zero. For some reason, there had been one or more malfunctions. The bomb’s parachute had failed to open, the bomb had burrowed into the ground, and the high-explosive detonators had fired improperly.<a id="filepos70574" href="#filepos71849">*</a> Though there had been a large, radioactively dirty blast, it had not been nuclear. The bomb had been a dud.</p>

<p id="filepos70807" class="calibre_21"><a href="#filepos33479">*</a> ASA, responsible largely for foreign communications intercepts and Army communications security, had increasingly been treated as a kind of low-wage workforce by the National Security Agency. The NSA used ASA and other service personnel to help staff its hundreds of listening posts around the globe. The Army, by amalgamating ASA into INSCOM, was among other things trying to regain some control over its own people.</p>
