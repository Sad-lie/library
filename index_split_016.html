<span><span class="calibre13">1950s, WHEN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL</span></span> was out, Hal Puthoff and his friends would take the bus over the causeway to Miami Beach. Starting at one of the public beaches, they would go a few yards out into the Atlantic and then swim along the seemingly endless strip of high-class hotels nearby. Unless you were a guest, you couldn’t get to the hotels any other way. So they would swim to a hotel they hadn’t tried in a while, and they would come ashore and hang around on its beach, looking at the girls, and after a while they would lounge in chairs by the hotel pool, ordering Cokes, pretending to be hotel guests, and when one of the hotel staff eventually got wise, they would run out onto the beach again, into the Atlantic, and then would swim on up to the next hotel. And the days passed like that, and in the evenings there was the band. It was a guitar band, mostly. On Friday nights they would play for Sears Roebuck, on a second-story veranda at the <a></a>big Sears store downtown, at the corner of Fourteenth Street and Biscayne Boulevard. The band was a form of advertising, to draw in the evening shoppers, and Hal and the others were dressed in suits, with their hair slicked down—Hal’s was a bushy pompadour, and hard to slick down—and the guitar music would carry through the tropical air … Nat King Cole, Buddy Holly, all the radio hits, but done with guitars. Hal and a couple of the other fellows played instruments known as “electric steel Hawaiian” guitars, made by the Gibson Company. They made a wonderful, loopy sound, evoking paradise right there in the humid night air of downtown Miami.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Hal Puthoff loved his electric steel Hawaiian guitar. He loved tinkering with electronic things like that, and building gadgets. He also had a ham radio set, and tapping away with his Morse code key, he talked to people all over the world with it—people in Cuba, Venezuela, New Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean, one time even Yugoslavia—all those dots and dashes in the ether. Other than that he was mostly shy and quiet, a short kid with a pompadour haircut and sad eyes, looking vaguely like the young Mick Jagger would look one day. Hal’s father, a personnel manager for a string of trucking companies, had died a few years before, and Hal and his mother had moved from Warren, Ohio, down here to Miami to live with his aunt. They didn’t have much money. Hal went to a vocational high school, and dreamed of becoming, someday, a radio deejay.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Two decades later, Hal Puthoff was a lecturer at Stanford University, in the electrical engineering department. He had a Stanford Ph.D., and a patent on a tunable infrared laser he’d invented, and he had just co-authored an influential textbook, <em class="calibre4">Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics</em>. At the age of thirty-three, he was a force to be reckoned with in the fast-growing field of laser physics and engineering.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">And he was at another turning point in his life. His first <a id="filepos197297"></a>marriage was failing. He was bored with teaching. In fact, he was becoming bored with academia in general.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff had a reputation for being creative and energetic, rolling up his sleeves and sweating the details, getting things done one way or another, however long it took. But he didn’t quite fit the gear-head engineer stereotype. In his quiet, shy way he was concerned about the meaning of it all, had been up to the Esalen Institute, had done some Gestalt psychology workshops, that kind of thing. There were phenomena, out there, that other scientists didn’t seem interested in exploring. But he was interested.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In 1969 Puthoff separated from his wife, then met and moved in with a new girlfriend. Soon he left the Stanford electrical engineering department, and joined a nearby think tank, Stanford Research Institute. SRI, as it was known, was spread out on a leafy, grassy, modernistically quadrangled campus in the town of Menlo Park, only a few miles south of the university. It had close ties to Stanford, but it was mainly fuelled by about seventy million dollars in government contracts annually, many of them highly classified. Among scientific thinktanks only the Rand Corporation was larger or more prestigious.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">SRI brought Puthoff on board to help out with a laser-related project for the government, but after a while the laser work began to tail off, and Puthoff had a new project in mind. He wanted to do some psi experiments, to see if they could shed light on some of the stranger reaches of quantum theory. After getting permission from his boss, Puthoff went out in search of funding for the project. He soon hooked up with a philanthropist friend from Texas—Bill Church, part owner of the Church’s Fried Chicken restaurant chain, and an amateur scientist as well—who gave him ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Then, of all people, an artist in New York contacted him. The artist, Ingo Swann, had been working as a subject in psi experiments at the City College of New York and the <a id="filepos199625"></a>American Society for Psychical Research, and had seen Puthoff’s proposal for funding. Swann told Puthoff about some of his reported feats, which included remotely altering the temperature of a graphite rod, and going “out of body” to view objects hidden in a laboratory.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After a few letters back and forth, Puthoff flew Swann out to SRI, to put him through some preliminary tests. He wasn’t sure how Swann would fit into his plans. He mainly wanted to see what a real psychic looked like in action.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">On June 6, 1972, two days after Swann had arrived in California, Puthoff brought him over to Stanford University, to a laboratory in the basement of the Varian Hall physics building. The laboratory housed a special, experimental magnetometer that had been built, with money from the Office of Naval Research, by a Stanford postdoctoral physics student, Arthur Hebard.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Hebard was hunting the subatomic particles known as quarks. His magnetometer was designed to measure, down in its protected measurement chamber, the extremely small magnetic field perturbations that passing quarks were expected to make.<a id="filepos200978" href="#filepos222221">*</a> To maintain this sensitivity, it had to keep from its inner sanctum all the electromagnetic noise of civilization, with barriers that included copper, aluminum, a special metal that confined magnetic fields, and a super-cooled superconductor. Puthoff, who had heard about the device through friends, considered it a perfect challenge for a psychic, and had arranged the visit beforehand with Hebard. If Swann could somehow affect the output of this heavily shielded magnetometer, then he definitely should be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Down in Hebard’s lab, Puthoff explained to Swann the basic workings of the magnetometer, and without further <a></a>ado, asked him to alter the magnetometer’s output. The magnetometer was mostly buried in a concrete well in the floor of the lab. Swann wasn’t sure what to make of it. He had never done anything like this before. After a while he declared that he would first try to see clairvoyantly inside the magnetometer, to get a better psychic grip. As he did so, the magnetometer’s steady output, printed on a nearby strip chart recorder, suddenly changed. Hebard and some of the other graduate students and staff who had gathered suspected that the disturbance was mundane—the result of some kind of coincidental noise in the magnetometer system. But to Puthoff, it seemed that the disturbances correlated closely with Swann’s efforts to change the output. And when he and Swann eventually left the lab, the output returned to its baseline value.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff, it should be said, was an exceptionally, almost eerily mild-mannered man. And it was as if his calmness were deliberate, a guard against passions underneath, a recognition that he was now venturing in strange territory—career-wrecking territory—and the slightest emotional tremor could pitch him into the abyss. Still, the passions drove him onward. He was reasonably convinced that Ingo Swann had done something paranormal to Arthur Hebard’s magnetometer, and he wanted to investigate such phenomena in more detail.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Puthoff wrote up a short, dry, guarded description of the Varian Hall event, and circulated it, along with copies of the strip recorder output, to some more potential funding sources, including one or two government offices. Within several weeks, to his great surprise, the government was knocking on his door. Hal Puthoff had stumbled into one of the strangest arms races in modern history.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">Governments have long dabbled with psi as an intelligence-gathering tool—probably as long as there have been people who claim to have psi abilities. The Israelites of the Old <a id="filepos203961"></a>Testament are said to have made military use of one of their prophets, <a id="filepos204040"></a>Elisha. The Greeks had their <a id="filepos204077"></a>oracles. The Elizabethan spy <a id="filepos204114"></a>John Dee consulted psychics, and questioned all-seeing “angels” through his crystal ball. Even in the twentieth century, as psi became increasingly controversial scientifically, Western governments continued to employ it, here and there, in wartime.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In a campaign against Hungary in 1919, for example, a Czech officer set up a psychic spying unit consisting of two enlisted men under his command. Putting them in hypnotic trances, he would ask the men to report clairvoyantly on enemy positions. The Czech Army also used “dowsers” to search for traps, mines, and drinking water. Later, in World War II, the Soviet Union was said to have made use of a Polish-born psychic named Wolf Messing. Adolf Hitler, who put a price on Messing’s head, employed his own astrologers and map-dowsers, the latter dangling pendulums over maps to try to detect Allied divisions and air units.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">After the Cold War began, the United States and Soviet Union continued to dabble with psi, but never on a significant scale. Then something very strange occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In February 1960 a sensational article appeared in a French magazine, <em class="calibre4">Science et Vie</em> (Science and Life). Titled “The Secret of the Nautilus,” it reported that the U.S. government, in secret tests, had successfully employed telepathy to communicate with the crew of the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em>, its first nuclear submarine, while the sub had been underneath the Arctic ice cap. According to the story, the telepathy project had the special attention of President Eisenhower, and involved the Navy, the Air Force, Westinghouse, General Electric, Bell Laboratories, and the Rand Corporation.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The implications seemed enormous, for communicating with deeply submerged submarines had always been an extremely important research goal. If it stayed submerged, a submarine would normally be unable to transmit or receive information, since the seawater above it would block all but <a></a>the very lowest and least useful radio frequencies. To communicate, the sub would have to surface and raise its radio antenna, thus exposing itself to enemy aircraft and spy satellites.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Telepathy seemed like the ideal solution, for it didn’t appear to be stopped by seawater or any other earthly obstacle. In time, perhaps, with the development of the proper error-correcting algorithms, telepathy would revolutionize all of communications technology. Broadcast radio and secret codes would become obsolete.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The problem was, the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> story seemed to evaporate the closer one got to it. An Air Force officer named in the story denied that any such incident had taken place, and the skipper of the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> insisted that the sub had been in dry dock during the period it was said to have been conducting telepathy tests beneath the Arctic. Perhaps most suspiciously of all, the stated accuracy rate of the tests had been far higher than parapsychologists usually reported for telepathy experiments.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> article had been written by a young <em class="calibre4">Science et Vie</em> staffer, Gerard Messadié. He in turn had been fed the story by a consulting editor named Jacques Bergier, who apparently had connections to French intelligence services. Bergier responded to skeptical queries by backpedalling from the story, and it soon began to seem that the whole thing had been fabricated—as Bergier’s private fraud, or perhaps as some kind of disinformation ploy, designed to stir up valuable data about any American psi research, or to encourage Russia to undertake wasteful research on psi. Or both. Eventually, even Gerard Messadié would admit that he had probably been fooled.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But if the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> story was declared a fake in the West, it had a very different reception in the East. The Soviets seemed to swallow it whole, and official American denials only served to confirm their suspicions that the entire episode <a id="filepos208656"></a>had occurred just as reported, and had been a deep military secret.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Soviet psi research had been nearly extinct during the Stalin years, thanks to official ideological opposition to anything smacking of “idealism” or “superstition.” Stalin’s successor, Nikita <a id="filepos209031"></a>Khrushchev, reportedly had opened the door somewhat, after witnessing the sensational displays of some Indian yogis during a state visit in 1955. But by 1960 no coordinated psi research program had yet developed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> story seemed to provide the necessary stimulus. Whether they believed it or not, a number of Soviet researchers eagerly cited the story as a confirmation of their own work, hinting that such work now needed much greater attention and funding. Leonid Vasiliev, chairman of the physiology department at the University of Leningrad, and a past winner of the Lenin Prize, would argue that “the discovery of the energy underlying ESP will be equivalent to the discovery of atomic energy.” By the early sixties, Vasiliev was heading a well-funded parapsychology laboratory, and the establishment of numerous other psi research centers followed.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Vasiliev’s work soon concentrated on “remote-influencing” experiments, for example in which a telepathic sender would try to put a distant receiver to sleep at a randomly selected time. Other researchers, like the electrical engineer I. M. <a id="filepos210332"></a>Kogan, spent more of their efforts on ordinary telepathy experiments. Kogan, like most Soviet researchers, assumed that psi was just a low-frequency radio system built into human brains. He therefore tried to characterize it in terms familiar to communications specialists. He concluded from his experiments that psi data could be transmitted within a laboratory at about 0.1 “bit” of information per second on average—about one five-letter word every five minutes—while the rate decreased to 0.005 bits per second for psi data transmitted across six hundred miles.</p>
<p class="calibre_14"><a id="filepos211006"></a>The Czechs were also active in psi research, and in the mid-1960s, a researcher named <a id="filepos211100"></a>Milan Ryzl conducted an experiment that seemed to confirm Kogan’s communications-oriented approach. A 50-bit target sequence of ones and zeros was generated randomly. Ryzl, who did not know the sequence, then asked the psychic Pavel Stepanek to repeatedly guess each bit in the sequence, going back and forth (in an order unknown to Stepanek) through the sequence again and again. Ryzl combined Stepanek’s guesses using a majority-vote error-correcting protocol, a technique like those used by telecommunications specialists to clean up signals on noisy transmission lines. After several days and twenty thousand guesses, Ryzl was confident that Stepanek had got the entire 50-bit sequence right. And he had.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Of course, with such a lengthy error-correcting protocol, the effective bit rate for the experiment turned out to be only about 0.0003 bps (one word per day), hardly a replacement for ordinary modes of telecommunication. But as a proof-of-concept experiment, it was impressive, suggesting that the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> story might not have been so farfetched after all.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Indeed, if the Soviet parapsychologist Eduard Naumov could be believed, the <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> results were old hat. At a conference in Moscow in 1968, Naumov announced to Western researchers that the Red Navy had replicated the entire <em class="calibre4">Nautilus</em> experiment successfully, using one of its own submarines. Not only that, claimed Naumov, but Soviet military researchers had developed a method for telepathically <em class="calibre4">tapping into</em> other people’s psychic communications.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Wild stories like Naumov’s eventually made their way into a book called <em class="calibre4">Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain</em>, published in the United States in 1970. Just after the acknowledgments page its authors, Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder, printed a table showing “some” of the <a id="filepos213209"></a>Eastern bloc cities where psi research was supposed to be taking place: Moscow, Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Tagil, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Tomsk, Omsk … forty cities in all. And it was a safe bet that in such cities as Moscow and Leningrad, there would be more than one such research center.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Ostrander and Schroeder portrayed a veritable frenzy of psychic research going on in the USSR, where investigators were apparently combing cities and villages, uncovering powerful natural clairvoyants, psychokinetic prodigies, and dowsers whose talents could presumably be employed against the West. There was some opposition to this kind of work, on ideological grounds, but it seemed generally to come from the older, more ideological wing of Soviet officialdom, a vestige of the dark past. In the USSR, it was the psi believers who now were wrapping themselves in the mantle of scientific and technological progress.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">By the late 1960s the U.S. intelligence community was becoming aware of all this, by way of popular books, official studies, Pentagon and CIA translations of foreign psi research papers, and agent and émigré reports. The first big result was a curiously titled Defense Intelligence Agency report, <em class="calibre4">Controlled Offensive Behavior—USSR</em>, which appeared in 1972. It noted that “the major impetus behind the Soviet drive to harness the possible capabilities of telepathic communication, telekinetics, and bionics are said to come from the Soviet military and the KGB.” The report went on to cite, with almost comical blandness, the various horrors that could one day be inflicted on America:</p>
<div class="calibre_26">
<blockquote class="calibre2"><p class="calibre_21">Soviet efforts in the field of psi research, sooner or later, might enable them to do some of the following: (a) Know the contents of top secret U.S. documents, the movements of our troops and ships and the location and nature of our military installations. (b) Mold the <a id="filepos215412"></a>thoughts of key U.S. military and civilian leaders at a distance. (c) Cause the instant death of any U.S. official at a distance. (d) Disable, at a distance, U.S. military equipment of all types including spacecraft.</p></blockquote>
</div><div class="calibre_4"> </div>
<p class="calibre_14">Thanks to the Soviet “head start” in psi research, argued the DIA report-writer, “Soviet knowledge in this field is superior to that of the West.” In other words, the United States, which already had to worry about a possible missile gap—a Soviet numerical superiority in ICBMs—now faced the prospect of a devastating “psi gap.”</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Not everyone agreed with the DIA’s fire-and-brimstone alarmism. To some at the CIA, for example, reports of Soviet and East European enthusiasm over psi only reinforced the notion that science in those countries was often heavily influenced by mystical beliefs. The parapsychologist Eduard Naumov, for example, was also into “<a id="filepos216550"></a>Kirlian photography” of human “biofields,” and believed that sunspots, by helping to shape a person’s biofield at birth, thus shaped his destiny.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">On the other hand, there were parapsychologists like I. M. Kogan, whose work seemed relatively serious. His work began to seem even more serious when it suddenly disappeared from public view in about 1969, coincident with reports that the KGB had begun to fund and direct his laboratory at the Popov Society.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">Precisely how well the KGB and the military were really able to harness psi to nefarious purposes was anybody’s guess, but they obviously were very interested, and there were reports of strange occurrences—perhaps mundane, but perhaps psi-related—that must have made a few American hairs stand on end. For example, near the end of his first term President Nixon made a very strange complaint to the CIA. According to testimony by CIA scientist Sidney Gottlieb at a congressional hearing in 1977, Nixon claimed that he and several members of his staff, including his personal <a id="filepos217781"></a>physician, Walter Tkach, had exhibited unusual behavior, including “inappropriate tears and crying,” during a visit to an unnamed “potentially hostile country” in the early 1970s. Nixon visited both China and the Soviet Union in 1972.</p>
<p class="calibre_23">The end result of all this was that American intelligence agencies began to spend more time monitoring psi research around the world, including research in the United States itself. The CIA and the Pentagon, which during the 1950s and ’60s had actually funded some low-key scientific investigations of possible psi applications, began to think about doing more research, covertly or overtly, to see whether the Soviets really were onto something. If U.S. researchers came up with nothing, then everyone could breathe a sigh of relief. If they produced something useful, then America would at least be able to stay in the race with the Russians.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">But who would carry out this research? The low scientific status of psi meant that it attracted few investigators. Even fewer of these investigators had serious scientific credentials, and of those who did, most were wrapped up in abstract statistical pursuits, safely beyond the realm of real-world applications. Others had already done some work for the CIA and other agencies, but had come up with nothing of practical value. In addition, these were the turbulent, politicized early seventies, and quite a number of promising parapsychologists, despite their financial desperation, would have eschewed any kind of government involvement anyway. To them, psi was too important—and too pure and too beautiful—to leave to the generals.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The eyes of the intelligence community soon alighted on Hal Puthoff, after his report of the Varian Hall episode began to circulate. Puthoff seemed to have everything going for him. He was a respected mainstream researcher and engineer, he worked at a top-rank think tank which already did a great deal of defense and intelligence work, and he <a id="filepos220012"></a>already had top-level clearances. Back in the early 1960s he had fulfilled his military service as a Navy officer at the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, later staying on as a civilian. He had earned a Pentagon commendation at NSA for his work towards a future generation of high-speed optical computers driven by light pulses rather than electrons. The bottom line was that Puthoff seemed like the perfect candidate to carry out secret, government-sponsored psi research.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">In October of that year, 1972, Ingo Swann was back at SRF’s offices in Menlo Park for a short visit. Puthoff told him that he had decided by this time that ESP experiments were more promising than psychokinesis. He ran Swann through some simple clairvoyance tests: Puthoff would leave an object inside a locked, thick-walled wooden box in a certain room, and Swann, accompanied by a second researcher, would enter the room and try to divine what was in the box.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">One day two men from Washington, who had evidently been in touch with Puthoff, brought their own target and put it in the experiment box. They watched as Swann described the contents of the box as follows: “I see something small, brown, and irregular, sort of like a leaf, or something that resembles it, except that it seems very much alive, like it’s even moving!” The target, which had been caught and placed in the box by one of the visitors, was in fact a large moth—brownish, leaflike, and very much alive.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">A few weeks later, back in New York, Swann received a phone call from Puthoff. The two men with the moth had decided to give him $50,000 to fund eight months of further research. If he and Swann could come up with a repeatable psi phenomenon, then perhaps more money would follow.</p>
<p class="calibre_14">The men, and their money, were from the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
